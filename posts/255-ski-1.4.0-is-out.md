title: "Ski 1.4.0 is out!"
date: August 20, 2022
---

TL;DR: [`ski-1.4.0`](https://github.com/trofi/ski/releases/tag/v1.4.0) is
available for download!

## What's new

I'll paste NEWS entry as is:

```
It's a new fork based on lates 1.3.2 version available. It's new home
is https://github.com/trofi/ski. There are many changes since 1.1.0.
We'll list a few here since 1.3.2:

** https://github.com/trofi/ski is a new Ski home.

** Build is fixed to work with modern glibc, binutils and linux kernel
headers versions.

** More linux syscalls are emulated to at least get basic printf() to
work. More work needs to be done before Ski user emulation can run real
world programs.

** Dropped outdated ski.spec from tarball.

** Dropped ski-config from installed files. Ski does not provide a
stable library interface.

** Dropped dynamic hook loading infrastructure support. Ski no longer
tries to load and execute any libraries via 'SKIHOOK_PATH'. LTDL is
not required anymore.

** libski is not installed any more and is considered an internal
implementation detail of Ski.
```

While preparing this release I had a lot of fun fiddling with
`autoconf` over past few hours. I hope I did not break `Ski` too much to
and it still builds for others.

## Ski status

`Ski` supports guest `linux` kernels up to `4.19`. Anything later does
not yet work as `HP_SIM` mode was removed from upstream kernel. `4.19`
kernel support is great though: you can run `gdb`, networking, `gcc`
and many other conventional tools right in the guest `VM`.

User mode emulation on the other hand is very weak. The "Hello World"
does run when built against modern `glibc`, but I expect many basic
things (like [bash](https://github.com/trofi/ski/issues/1)) to be still
broken. It's good enough for proof of concept, but expect to fix many
bugs if you want to run a real application.

Text `xterm` interface (`ski`/`bski`) seems to work great. `motif`
(`xski`) and `gtk` (`gski`) interfaces look completely broken. I fixed
their compilation, but they render something unusable. I'm not sure if
it was ever functional enough to be usable. If I get a bit more
confidence in that I'll probably just remove `xski` / `gski` in next
release.

## More words

Previous `Ski` release was out in February 2008, 14 years ago. A few
things changed in the world since then. Incomplete list:

- `IA64` support in `linux` kernel was added, matured, slowed down and
  almost got removed.
- In 2020 Intel stopped producing new CPUs.
- Various `glibc`, `linux` kernel and `binutils` interfaces were changed.
  That broke the `Ski` build.
- New `linux` syscalls (like `openat`) and `AT_*` (like `AT_RANDOM`)
  auxiliary vectors were added and are now required by `glibc`. That
  broke the `Ski` user emulation.
- `HP_SIM` mode was [removed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=fc5bad03709f9c79ea299f554b6f99fc6f4fe31c)
  from upstream `linux` kernel. That broke `Ski` kernel/machine
  emulation on guest recent kernels.
- `gcc` support slowly bit rots breaking more and more projects that
  build with `-O3`.
- I lost access to `guppy` box and did not do much `IA64`-related tinkering
  lately.

Sounds bad, eh?

Fear not! Things are not as grim as they might look. Lack of real
hardware access happens to be a good motivation for me to clear the dust
off good old `Ski`. Lack of new CPUs means that it's not a moving target
anymore (not that it ever did :) and we can just build a perfect (ahem)
emulator.

I still have about 20 minor kernel patches to upstream and would like
to get an emulator to support latest kernels to test these patches.

### Pre-built `OS` images

A few months ago someone asked me if I had `OS` images left for `Ski` to
run. I did not have them and spent a few minutes recreating them. The
result is [here](https://slyfox.uni.cx/ia64/):

- [running instructions](https://slyfox.uni.cx/ia64/HOWTO_RUN): unpack
  and run.
- [rebuilding instructions](https://slyfox.uni.cx/ia64/NOTES.ia64):
  build a cross-compiler, kernel and unpack Gentoo's `stage3`.

It has an userspace with `gcc-11.3.0`. Not too old.

### `nixpkgs` attempt at building `OS` images

Gentoo's support for large scale cross-compilation is a bit hairy.
I wondered if I could make `OS` image building based on `nixpkgs` to
reuse all my local hacks I use to tinker with the system.

A few days ago **matoro** asked me to send the fix **matoro** did for
[`ITC` precision detection](https://bugs.gentoo.org/596382) upstream. I
took it as an opportunity to bring up an equivalent test environment
on `NixOS` locally (and to find out how `ia64` timers really work in
`linux`).

Initially I built just an `ia64-unknown-linux-gnu` cross-compiler. It
took 3 lines of `nixpkgs` code:

```
lib/systems/examples.nix:  ia64 = { config = "ia64-unknown-linux-gnu"; };
lib/systems/inspect.nix:    isIa64         = { cpu = { family = "ia64"; }; };
lib/systems/parse.nix:    ia64     = { bits = 64; significantByte = littleEndian; family = "ia64"; };
```

That (and a few small one-off tweaks) allowed me to build vast majority
of packages for `ia64` with one command: `bash`, `strace`, `mc`,
`busybox`, `gcc`, `iproute2`, `tmux`, `git`, `util-linux`, `gdb`. `re2c`
building example:

```
$ nix build -f. pkgsCross.ia64.re2c

$ file result/bin/re2c
result/bin/re2c: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, IA-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked,
  interpreter /nix/store/...-glibc-ia64-unknown-linux-gnu-2.35-163/lib/ld-linux-ia64.so.2,
  for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, not stripped
```

Kernel was slightly harder to get running as it required 2 `CONFIG_`
options to be disabled to get something bootable:

```nix
# lib/systems/platforms.nix:

  ia64 = {
    linux-kernel = {
      name = "ia64";
      target = "vmlinuz";
      autoModules = false;
      baseConfig = "sim_defconfig";
      extraConfig = ''
        # Disable for gcc bug: https://gcc.gnu.org/PR106617
        LIBFC n

        # otherwise kernel panics in SKI
        SERIAL_8250 n
      '';
    };
  };
```

Here the main bit is `sim_defconfig` for `HP_SIM` mode and a
`SERIAL_8250 n` work around to prevent the kernel from crashing. Oh,
and it has to be a `4.19` kernel (`5.0` removed `HP_SIM` mode),
thus the command to build the kernel is:
`nix build -f. pkgsCross.ia64.linuxPackages_4_19.kernel`.

As I was foolish enough to use very fresh `gcc` I encountered a
`gcc` bug: <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR106617>.

The above was good enough to put together minimal runnable `OS` image. I
wondered if I could also generate full `rootfs` as a `.nix` expression
to later use it as is for making an `ext2` image. The trick is to
grab full closure of dependencies and put it in a single directory.
**tpw_rules** pointed me at a [`closureInfo`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/search?q=closureInfo)
magic function which allows doing exactly that kind of things.

Just one `rsync` call is enough to build full `rootfs`! Here is my
`.nix` expression to get a virtual machine with `busybox`, `re2c`, `ski`
run script and `/init` script to boot a full VM:

```nix
# $ cat busybox-and-re2c.nix
{ pkgs ? import ~/n {}
, pkgsCross ? pkgs.pkgsCross.ia64
, targetKernel ? pkgsCross.linuxPackages_4_19.kernel
}:

rec {
  init-script = pkgs.writeScriptBin "init" (''
    #!${pkgsCross.busybox}/bin/busybox sh

    # expose both packages in the PATH
    export PATH=${pkgsCross.re2c}/bin:${pkgsCross.busybox}/bin

    # prepare file hierarchy
    mkdir -p /dev /proc
    mount -t proc proc /proc
    mount -t devtmpfs devtmpfs /dev

    # run the shell
    exec ${pkgsCross.busybox}/bin/busybox sh
  '');

  rootfs = pkgs.runCommand "rootfs" { closure = pkgs.closureInfo { rootPaths = [ init-script ]; }; } ''
    mkdir -p $out
    cd $out

    # Copy full closure locally
    ${pkgs.rsync}/bin/rsync -arv --files-from=$closure/store-paths / .

    # build convenience symlinks:
    ln -s ${init-script}/bin/init init
  '';

  run-script = pkgs.writeScriptBin "run-ia64-ski" ''
    #!${pkgs.bash}/bin/bash
    bski=${pkgs.ski}/bin/bski
    bootloader=${targetKernel.dev}/bootloader
    vmlinux=${targetKernel.dev}/vmlinux
    rootfs=${rootfs}
    image_size=1G
    image=./sdc

    set -e

    if [ ! -e "$image" ]; then
        echo "Populating '$image' with '$rootfs'..."
        fallocate -l "$image_size" "$image"
        mke2fs -d ${rootfs}/ "$image"
    fi

    $bski $bootloader $vmlinux root=/dev/sda simscsi=./sd init=/init rw TERM=xterm "$@"
  '';
}
```

We define 3 build targets above:

- `init-script`: our target's init script which will run first in a
  guest VM.
- `rootfs`: magic command to copy all the dependency closure context
  into a single `$out` directory.
- `run-script`: our host's script to run the virtual machine.

The whole thing can be built and ran in a single command as:

```
$ $(nix-build busybox-and-re2c.nix -A run-script)/bin/run-ia64-ski

Just `44MB` uncompressed! We can shrink it down to `9MB` by compressing
it:

```
$ xz -9 sdc
$ LANG=C ls -lh
-rw-r--r-- 1 slyfox users 8.6M Aug 20 08:02 sdc.xz
```

That's even smaller than uncompressed kernel, which is around `21MB`:

```
$ ls -lh /nix/store/jiqn22d0yp80vvysib16xjnb8w6j7c1v-linux-ia64-unknown-linux-gnu-4.19.255-dev/vmlinux |unnix
-r-xr-xr-x 2 root root 21M Jan  1  1970 /<<NIX>>/linux-ia64-unknown-linux-gnu-4.19.255-dev/vmlinux
```

You can also inspect `rootfs` from the host side without having to deal
with filesystem image or booting an `OS`:

```
$ nix-build busybox-and-re2c.nix -A rootfs
/nix/store/11ig1jh624l5dniilcp2p8s2zjigrz44-rootfs

$ ls -1 result/nix/store/
1mrb68yaa7cn2x8lzq13vgd4gy6icz2i-re2c-ia64-unknown-linux-gnu-3.0

xhkazsq7p21kj6853vfv7w244bbfa854-busybox-ia64-unknown-linux-gnu-1.35.0
```

That alone allowed me to fix a bunch of packages in `nixpkgs` (example
[upstream `mc` fix](https://midnight-commander.org/changeset/0ef7237eea2ef97e92b793c0429be4d1ea6ffc77)).

It's such a fun toy to play with!

### `HP_SIM` mode limitations

To do a full system emulation `Ski` relies on `HP_SIM` mode of kernel
build. It's very different from the real `ia64` kernel you build for a
real device. And different from `KVM`! A few points on why `HP_SIM` is
special:

- Separate `bootloader` binary is required to boot `vmlinux`
  (`bootloader` is built as part of `linux` kernel)
- No firmware initialization code, to memory map discovery. The map is
  hardcoded in `bootloader` code.
- Paravirtual devices (`simserial`, `simeth`, `simscsi`) require
  `Ski`-specific hypercalls from guest kernel to `Ski`.
- No support for `virtio` from `Ski`.
- No ACPI bus.
- No PCI bus.
- No `initramfs` support (lack of interface to pass it to `bootloader`)

### Possible next steps for `Ski`

The above are not fundamental limitations. I think it would not be hard
to get rid of custom device code and switch over to `virtio-mmio`
entirely. I imagine it would be something like:

- `simserial` -> `virtio-console`
- `simscsi` -> `virtio-blk`
- `simeth` -> `virtio-net`

It will require a bit of code on `Ski` side to handle `virtio` queues.
Maybe we can borrow parts of `qemu` as is? Otherwise, implementing them
does not sound too hard.

Lack of buses is fine as well. VMs for other architectures seem to do
it for ages and rely on device trees or manual kernel config options.
We can do there same here. It would be useful though to get closer to
real `ia64` for interface discovery eventually.

Lack of platform initialization code should not be a big problem either:
`ia64` platform is defined in terms of `PAL` and `SAL` calls which are
very similar (at least in spirit) to current `HP_SIM` hypercalls.

## Parting words

`Ski` is still alive! Try [1.4.0](https://github.com/trofi/ski/releases/tag/v1.4.0) :)

`ia64` code can still be emulated and be debugged with `Ski`. Both can
still expose generic bugs in various projects.

`Ski` is a great example of project on how little one needs to add to
guest `linux` kernel and to hypervisor to boot the kernel and get
user space running there.

Instruction emulation is a large part of `Ski`. I still don't quite get
it. But I also never had a reason for deeper investigation. Maybe one day.
Meanwhile, it just works!

Have fun!
