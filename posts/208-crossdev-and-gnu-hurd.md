title: "crossdev and GNU Hurd"

Tl;DR: `crossdev` is a tool to generate a cross-compiler for you in
`gentoo` and with some hacks (see below) you can even cross-compile to
`hurd`!

`FOSDEM` 2018 conference happened recently and a lot of cool talks
tool place there. The full list counts [689
events](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/events/)!
[Hurd's `PCI`
arbiter](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/microkernel_hurd_pci_arbiter/)
was a nice one. I never actually tried `hurd` before and thought to
give it a try in a VM.

`Debian` already provides full `hurd` installer ([installation
manual](https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install)) and I picked
it. `hurd` works surprisingly well for a such an understaffed project!
Installation process is very simple: it's a typical `debian` `CD` which
asks you for a few details about final system (same as for `linux`)
and you get your `OS` booted.
`hurd` has a ton of `debian` software already built and working
(like 80% of the whole repo). Even `GHC` is ported there. While at it
I grabbed all the tiny `GHC` patches related to `hurd` from Debian
and pushed them upstream:

- [`PIC`
  support](http://git.haskell.org/ghc.git/commitdiff/0693b0b0500236a3dec933350a13f1b0e8c1cb54)
- [allow canonical `hurd`
  tuple](http://git.haskell.org/ghc.git/commitdiff/1522cf05c9c3e9afd3ef9c7f3f419460c41488d9)

Now plain `./configure && make && make test` just works.
Hurd supports only 32-bit `x86` CPUs and does not support `SMP` (only one
CPU is available). That makes building heavyweight stuff (like `GHC`)
in a virtual machine a slow process.

To speed things up a bit I decided to build a cross-compiler from
`gentoo linux` to `hurd` with the help of `crossdev`. What does it
take to support bootstrap like that? Let's see!
To get the idea of how to cross-compile to another `OS` let's check how
typical `linux` to `linux` case looks like.
Normally aiming `gcc` at another `linux-glibc` target takes the
following steps:

``` 
- install cross-binutils
- install system headers (kernel headers and glibc headers):
- install minimal gcc without glibc support (not able to link final executables yet)
- install complete glibc (gcc will need crt.o files)
- install full gcc (able to link final binaries for C and C++)
```

In `gentoo` `crossdev` does all the above automatically by running
`emerge` a few times for you. I wrote a more up-to-date [`crossdev`
README](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/crossdev.git/plain/README) to
describe a few details of what is happening when you run `crossdev -t
<target>`.
`hurd-glibc` is not fundamentally different from `linux-glibc` case.
Only a few packages need to change their names, namely:

``` 
- install cross-binutils
- install gnumach-headers (kernel headers part 1)
- [NEW] install cross-mig tool (Mach Interface Generator, a flavour of IDL compiler)
- install hurd-headers and glibc-headers (kernel headers part 2 and libc headers)
- install minimal gcc without libc support (not able to link final executables yet)
- install complete libc (gcc will need crt.o files)
- install full gcc (able to link final binaries for C and C++)
```

The only change from `linux` is the `cross-mig` tool. I've
collected `ebuild`s needed in [`gentoo-hurd`
overlay](https://github.com/trofi/gentoo-hurd).

Here is how one gets `hurd` `cross-compiler` with today's
`crossdev-99999999`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trofi/gentoo-hurd.git

HURD_OVERLAY=$(pwd)/gentoo-hurd
CROSS_OVERLAY=$(portageq get_repo_path / crossdev)
TARGET_TUPLE=i586-pc-gnu

# this will fail around glibc, it's ok we'll take on manually from there
crossdev --l 9999 -t crossdev -t ${TARGET_TUPLE}

ln -s "${HURD_OVERLAY}"/sys-kernel/gnumach ${CROSS_OVERLAY}/cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/
ln -s "${HURD_OVERLAY}"/dev-util/mig ${CROSS_OVERLAY}/cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/
ln -s "${HURD_OVERLAY}"/sys-kernel/hurd ${CROSS_OVERLAY}/cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/

emerge -C cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/linux-headers

ACCEPT_KEYWORDS='**' USE=headers-only  emerge -v1 cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/gnumach
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS='**' USE=headers-only  emerge -v1 cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/mig
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS='**' USE=headers-only  emerge -v1 cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/hurd
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS='**' USE=headers-only  emerge -v1 cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/glibc

                     USE="-*"          emerge -v1 cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/gcc
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS='**' USE=-headers-only emerge -v1 cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/glibc
                     USE="-sanitize"   emerge -v1 cross-${TARGET_TUPLE}/gcc
```

Done!

A few things to note here:

- `gentoo-hurd` overlay is used for new `gnumach`, `mig` and `hurd`
  packages
- symlinks to new packages are created manually (`crossdev` fix pending,
  wait on packages to get into `::gentoo`)
- uninstall `linux-headers` as our target is not linux (`crossdev` fix
  pending)
- use `ACCEPT_KEYWORDS='**'` for many packages (need to decide on
  final keywords, maybe `x86-hurd`)
- all `crossdev` phases are ran manually
- only `glibc` `git` version is working as changes were merged upstream
  [very
  recently](https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2018-04/msg00017.html).
- `USE="sanitize"` is disabled in final `gcc` because it's broken for
  `hurd`

Now you can go to `/usr/${TARGET_TUPLE}/etc/portage/` and tweak the
defaults for `ELIBC`, `KERNEL` and other things.
Basic sanity check for a toolchain:

``` 
$ i586-pc-gnu-gcc main.c -o main
$ file main
main: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld.so, for GNU/Hurd 0.0.0, with debug_info, not stripped
```

Copying to the target `hurd` VM and running there also works as
expected.
I use `crossdev -t x86_64-HEAD-linux-gnu` to have `GHC` built
against `HEAD` in parallel to system's `GHC`. Let's use that for
more heavyweight test to build a `GHC` cross-compiler to `hurd`:

``` 
$ EXTRA_ECONF=--with-ghc=x86_64-HEAD-linux-gnu-ghc emerge -v1 cross-i586-pc-gnu/ghc --quiet-build=n
```

This fails as:

``` 
rts/posix/Signals.c:398:28: error:
     note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
    |
398 |         action.sa_flags |= SA_SIGINFO;
    |                            ^
```

Which hints at lack of `SA_SIGINFO` support in upstream `glibc.git`.
`Debian` has an out-of-tree [`tg-hurdsig-SA_SIGINFO.diff`
patch](https://sources.debian.org/patches/glibc/2.27-3/hurd-i386/tg-hurdsig-SA_SIGINFO.diff/)
to provide these defines (as least it's not our local toolchain
breakage). The outcome is positive: we have got very far into
cross-compiling and hit real portability issues. Woohoo!

## Final words

As long as underlying toolchains are not too complicated building
cross-compilers in `gentoo` is trivial. Next tiny step is to
cross-build `hurd` kernel itself and run it in `qemu`. `ebuild`s in
`gentoo-hurd` are not yet ready for it but tweaking them should be
easy.

Have fun!
