title: "ski 1.5.0 is out"

TL;DR: [`ski-1.5.0`](https://github.com/trofi/ski/releases/tag/v1.5.0) is
available for download!

It is primarily a maintenance release that completely removes `motif` and
`gtk` backends, fixes building against `C23` toolchains and adds a small
`-initramfs` option to supply separate `initramfs` file to be used along
with emulated kernel.

[`1.4.0`](/posts/255-ski-1.4.0-is-out.html) announcement has a few hints
on how to run it.

Have fun!
