title: "A small update on 'make --shuffle' mode"
date: June 21, 2022
---

# Tl;DR

GNU Make `--shuffle` mode was releases as part of GNU make 4.4 \\o/.

Note that `--shuffle` is not enabled by default. You can enable it
by any of below methods whichever matches best your environment:

- Run `make --shuffle`. For casual testing.
- Export `GNUMAKEFLAGS=--shuffle` environment variable. For
  day-to-day development or distribution-wide testing. It is also a
  safe value for `GNU make` that does not yet understand `--shuffle`
  option.

  Update: changed ~~MAKEFLAGS~~ to `GNUMAKEFLAGS` as `bmake` does not
  skip unknown options and fails. Noticed by Toralf.
- Apply <https://slyfox.uni.cx/distfiles/make/make-4.3.90.20220619-random-by-default.patch>
  on top of snapshot tarball. Useful for environments where there is no
  easy way to pass a parameter to `make` or to set `GNUMAKEFLAGS`
  variable.

# minor improvements

Compared to the initial patch announced as a
[proof of concept](/posts/238-new-make-shuffle-mode.html)
there is one extra change: presence of `.NOTPARALLEL:` directive
in a `Makefile` now disables shuffling in that file.

It was done to accommodate rare projects that rely on execution order
specified in `Makefile` and don't plan to make dependencies correct
in near future. The example is `netpbm`:
