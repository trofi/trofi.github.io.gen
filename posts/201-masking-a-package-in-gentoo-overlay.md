title: masking a package in gentoo overlay

It's a post on how to selectively mask an `ebuild` in the overlay. The
running example will be a package `app-misc/foo` using `systemd`
(`systemd` is masked in `selinux` profiles).

Here is how our `ebuild` looks like:

``` bash
# Copyright 1999-2017 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2

DESCRIPTION="An example package with a depend masked in selinux profiles."
HOMEPAGE="https://trofi.github.io/"

KEYWORDS="~amd64 ~x86 ~ppc ~ppc64"
LICENSE="public-domain"
SLOT="0"

# systemd is masked on selinux profiles
DEPEND="sys-apps/systemd"
RDEPEND=${DEPEND}
```

The problem with it is that it's not usable on `selinux` profiles due to
`systemd` mask:

``` 
overlay-selective-mask-in-gentoo/app-misc $ repoman full

RepoMan scours the neighborhood...
  dependency.bad [fatal]        3
   app-misc/foo/foo-0.ebuild: DEPEND: ~amd64(hardened/linux/amd64/no-multilib/selinux)
['sys-apps/systemd']
   app-misc/foo/foo-0.ebuild: DEPEND: ~amd64(hardened/linux/amd64/selinux)
['sys-apps/systemd']
   app-misc/foo/foo-0.ebuild: DEPEND: ~x86(hardened/linux/x86/selinux)
['sys-apps/systemd']
```

Thus our goal is to mask this package on `selinux` profiles. Unfortunately
it requires quite a few steps to do it:

1.  Add `profiles/profiles.desc` file and populate it with all
    profiles we want to override.

    `repoman` already shows us `3` profiles we need to override.

    We need to create `profiles/profiles.desc` file with the following
    contents:

    ``` 
    amd64           hardened/linux/amd64/selinux                            stable
    amd64           hardened/linux/amd64/no-multilib/selinux                stable
    x86             hardened/linux/x86/selinux                              stable
    ```

2.  Create `package.mask` which we will use for our overrides.

    I've added our mask to new
    `profiles/features/selinux/package.mask` file:

    ``` 
    # Sergei Trofimovich <slyfox@gentoo.org> (24 Jun 2016)
    # requires systemd (masked on selinux)
    app-misc/foo
    ```

3.  Create profile overrides for each profile.

    Let's look in detail on `hardened/linux/x86/selinux` profile.
    It's override requires a single file.

    Let's create `profiles/hardened/linux/x86/selinux/parent` with
    the following contents:

    ``` 
    gentoo:hardened/linux/x86/selinux
    :features/selinux
    ```

    Here `gentoo:hardened/linux/x86/selinux` refers to parent profile
    and `:features/selinux` refers to our tiny mix in with single
    `package.mask`.

4.  Enable `portage-2` extension to `metadata/layout.conf`.

    Unfortunately `[repo]:<absolute-path>` is not defined in
    `PMS` and is not portable across all Gentoo package managers.

    To enable it for portage we need to add the following in
    `metadata/layout.conf`:

    ``` 
    profile-formats = portage-2
    ```

Done!

Now `repoman` is happy:

``` 
overlay-selective-mask-in-gentoo/app-misc $ repoman full

RepoMan scours the neighborhood...

Note: use --without-mask to check KEYWORDS on dependencies of masked packages
Note: use --include-dev (-d) to check dependencies for 'dev' profiles

RepoMan sez: "If everyone were like you, I'd be out of business!"
