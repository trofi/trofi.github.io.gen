title: "Filter out AAAA DNS responses"
date: November 07, 2020

## `Tl;DR`: with `RPZ` we can hide `AAAA` records while preserving other records

For those who look up the way to filter out `AAAA` records in their local
caching DNS server here is my `unbound` snippet for a single `ipv6`
address:

``` 
$ cat /etc/unbound/rpz.home
$ORIGIN rpz.home.
;; fails to resolve: https://bugs.gentoo.org/742326
;; block 2607:fcc0:4:ffff::4/128 -> NODATA (CNAME *.)
128.4.0.0.0.ffff.4.fcc0.2607.rpz-ip.rpz.home. CNAME *.

$ cat /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
server:
    ... usual configuration goes here
    module-config: "respip validator iterator"

rpz:
    name: rpz.home.
    zonefile: /etc/unbound/rpz.home
```

Resolver can't see the `ipv6` address, only `ipv4`:

``` 
$ dig bugs.gentoo.org AAAA @8.8.8.8
gannet.gentoo.org.      21599   IN      AAAA    2607:fcc0:4:ffff::4
$ dig bugs.gentoo.org AAAA | fgrep AAAA
# nothing

$ dig bugs.gentoo.org A @8.8.8.8
gannet.gentoo.org.      21599   IN      A       204.187.15.4
$ dig bugs.gentoo.org A
gannet.gentoo.org.      20091   IN      A       204.187.15.4
```

You can do full sub-networks as well.

## Why would I need it?

The other day I tried to reach `bugs.gentoo.org` programmatically over
HTTP API and observed 100% traffic loss. `wget` was also showing
hangups:

``` 
$ wget bugs.gentoo.org
--2020-09-19 09:24:22--  http://bugs.gentoo.org/
Resolving bugs.gentoo.org... 2607:fcc0:4:ffff::4, 204.187.15.4
Connecting to bugs.gentoo.org|2607:fcc0:4:ffff::4|:80...
# hung up
^C

$ wget -4 bugs.gentoo.org
--2020-09-19 09:25:02--  http://bugs.gentoo.org/
Resolving bugs.gentoo.org... 204.187.15.4

```

As a workaround I added `AAAA` response filtering locally as specified
in `TL;DR` to unblock the scripts.
