title: "Shrinking closure example"
date: September 24, 2022

Sometimes I check `nixpkgs` packages I use for unexpected
development-only runtime dependencies. I do it mostly to shrink download
sizes for things I update frequently.

I developed a few hacks to find things quickly. The primary hack is to
grep dependency graph of an executable-only package (say, a game) for
`-dev` packages in its runtime closure. Here is an example for `fheroes2`
package:

```
$ nix-store -q --graph $(nix-build -A fheroes2) | grep -P -- '-dev.*->' | grep -vP -- '->.*-dev'
"4bdanp07rax5mazgjzgdwx61sf6p01qc-SDL2-2.0.22-dev" -> "nj09vl0pzc41sn4wh7q2vlppmkv3dhiy-SDL2_mixer-2.0.4" [color = "burlywood"];
...
```

Here we see that `SDL2.dev` package is pulled into `SDL2_mixer.out`
runtime closure. It's a bug.

More interesting hack is to grep full runtime closure for files that
are clearly development-only: `C` header files, `pkg-config` files and so
on. Here is a `grep` example again for `fheroes2`:

```
$ find $(nix path-info -r $(nix-build -A fheroes2)) | grep -P [.]h$ | shuf | unnix | nl | tail -n 2
  1301  /<<NIX>>/libnfnetlink-1.0.2/include/libnfnetlink/libnfnetlink.h
  1302  /<<NIX>>/xorgproto-2021.5/include/X11/extensions/dpmsproto.h
```

Here we see that `xorgproto` (header-only package) and `libnfnetlink`
(package without a separate `.dev` output) pull in development headers
into our precious game. Both are probably unintended and worth a fix.

To get rid of the dependencies I usually add `dev` outputs to libraries
without `dev` output like a recent
[`libfido2` example](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/191775/commits/d04acb8a96c2ae37dd4ff58db65dedfab8d3d79f):

Sometime I have to explicitly change the package to not retain
build-only dependencies. Here is a recent
[`freedroidrpg` example](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/191810/commits/02ba9a3d60c6c45e1df45714a2a3db714eed9c18):

Sometimes you might also need to add `propagatedBuildInputs = ...` to make
headers-only `dev` output self-contained.

Is it worth the hassle? If feels like development headers don't take
that much space anyway. It's true that some packages have tiny overhead.
But things add up quickly. For example,
[`freedroidrpg PR`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/191810) shrinks
runtime closure from `808MB` down to `450MB` (`44%` reduction). While
[`fheroes2 PRs`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/191770#issuecomment-1250247308)
shrunk runtime closure from `622MB` down to `557MB` (`11%` reduction).

These are just two examples I found in 5 minutes. There are many more
packages you can fix in `nixpkgs`! Give it a try!

Have fun!
