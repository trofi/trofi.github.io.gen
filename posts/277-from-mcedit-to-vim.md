title: "from mcedit to vim"

## Tl;DR

It's a blog post about text editor. You probably want to ignore it :)

I tried `vim` again and got it to behave close enough to `mcedit`. Now I
can use it with the following minimal `.vimrc`:

```vimrc
silent! source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim

colorscheme darkblue
" default color is invisible blue-on-blue
highlight MatchParen ctermbg=green

" just maintain the indent
set autoindent

" copy the indentation style from previous line
set copyindent

" do preserve tab/space mix on change
set preserveindent

" always render tabs even if a single file is open
set showtabline=2

" always render status line below
set laststatus=2

set list
set listchars=tab:<->,trail:.

" vim enables xterm-style Ctrl-<arrows> keys based on $TERM variable
" name. term=screen-256color does not trigger it. Let's work it around
" by clobbering it.
set term=xterm-256color
```

And it looks like that:

If you really want to know my path to `vim` here is a long story.

## MS-DOS times

My first ever encounter with text editors was a monochrome blue/white
LCD display. It was attached to some 286 "portable" computer weighting
about 20 kilograms. It emitted the calming buzzing sound I will never
forget. And it ran
[Norton Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander)
as the primary shell.

![nc.exe pic from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/Norton_Commander_5.51.png)

Others also used [Volkov Commander](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkov_Commander)
clone. It looks almost identical to the untrained eye.

![vc.exe pic from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/7/73/Volkov_commander4_screen.png)

They both had an editor built right into file manager accessible via
`<F4>` key binding. I did not edit many files there and only saw others
doing it.

## Windows times

On windows machines I used [Total Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Commander)
as a shell and don't remember much about the editors I used. Bare
`notepad` was probably a thing. Windows environment did not have many
text files to tweak. Thus, it was not important.
The tiny amount of programming I did happened in
[Turbo Pascal IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) and in
[Visual Studio 6.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio#6.0_(1998)).

![turbo.exe pic from winworldpc.com](https://winworldpc.com/res/img/screenshots/967c1c190fa98b954e706b532193194d0bac135b24e577a11cf12325aeba31cb.png)

`Turbo Pascal` was a great IDE: it had syntax highlighting, go-to-error
navigation, built in compile/build progress reporter, breakpoint
debugger, intuitive compiler flag combo boxes and may other things I did
not appreciate at the time. Being a `DOS`-based program it looked like a
miracle.

It defined my expectation of the ideal environment.

## Linux times

In the first year of university I started writing first non-trivial
programs. Around the same time I switched to `Linux` as my desktop.

`Linux` (as you might already suspect at this point) was full of text
files one has to tweak to adapt it to your environment. It was even more
important in those day than nowadays. One of the books I bought (of
"Linux for dummies" kind) allocated about 200 pages on the problem of
getting Russian language (or at least character set) and fonts to work in 
various programs. Text editors, audio players, `gtk` apps, `qt` apps,
`x11` apps, email programs, file system encodings all had to be
re-configured (and sometimes patched) for interoperability
with dual-booted windows.

To give you a gist of the kind of the problems one encountered: Russian
had 3 popular 8-bit character sets at the time. `CP866` was used in `MS-DOS`.
`CP1251` aew used in windows GUI. And `KOI8-R` was used in e-mail and many
`Linux` distributions (but not all of them!). There was also an
`ISO-8859-5` I never saw being used in real world.

### Russian encodings digression

All Russian encoding have their own strange and charming properties.

[`KOI8-R`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOI8-R) is the
fanciest of the three: it's main design is to remain readable even if
highest bit of each byte is stripped by unforgiving email or terminal
systems out there that assumed 7-bit ASCII.

So the Cyrillic text would be mangled into a transliterated version of
Russian:

```
$ echo 'Ужасы кодировок времен царя Гороха' | iconv -t koi8-r | perl -pe 'tr/\x80-\xFF/\x00-\x7F/' | iconv -f koi8-r
        uVASY KODIROWOK WREMEN CARQ gOROHA

$ echo 'АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМПОНРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯ' | iconv -t koi8-r | perl -pe 'tr/\x80-\xFF/\x00-\x7F/' | iconv -f koi8-r
        abwgde3vzijklmponrstufhc~{}yx|`q

$ echo 'абвгдеёжзийклмнопрстyфxцчшщъыьэюя' | iconv -t koi8-r | perl -pe 'tr/\x80-\xFF/\x00-\x7F/' | iconv -f koi8-r
        ABWGDE#VZIJKLMNOPRSTyFxC^[]_YX\@Q
```

Some of the letters are missing: it's not very easy to map 33
Cyrillic letters into 26 Latin ones. You have only one bit to flip and
do translation consistently across upper and lower case. It's a
marvelous hack.

To clarify: even being a native language speaker it's not easy to read
such mangled text. But at least you can recognize most words and guess
strange letters. If you know nothing about Cyrillic you can spot the
similarities (and differences) in Cyrillic and Latin alphabets side by
side.

This way of construction means that Cyrillic letters don't go in
alphabetic order in `KOI8-R` character set. They are scattered all over the
space. This means that naive sorting based on `strcmp()` does not
produce anything close to alphabetic sorting.

[`CP866`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_866) and
[`CP1251`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1251) are mostly safe in
this regard. But they also have their own caveats.
For example in `CP1251` `я` letter has `0xFF` value. Many programs at
that time had a bug of this sort:

```c
FILE * f = ...;
char c;

while ((c = getc(f)) != EOF) {
    ...
}
```

The bug here is in `getc()` result (of type `int`) truncation down to
`c` (of type `char`).

In `!=` comparison `signed char` systems sign-extend `0xFF` (`(char)-1`)
to `0xFFffFFff` (`(int)-1`, and `EOF`).

As a result some text editors (or even `FTP` and `IRC` clients and
servers!) unaware of Cyrillic would silently eat rest of your file if
you were to type (or receive!) 'я' in it.

While `strcmp()` produces mostly alphabetical sorting there is one
exception: it's the letter `Ё` / `ё`. It stands outside the rest of
the alphabet probably because it's not present in all Slavic Cyrillic
alphabets.

It took the ecosystem quite a while to adopt `strcoll()` style sorting.
And then `UTF-8` came and broke it again.

## Back to Linux: towards `mc`

Given the proliferation of encoding one's text editor should better
support all these encodings. Alas, I picked one that does not. I stuck
to something that resembles my good old `Norton Commander` friend:
[`Midnight Commander`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander)

![mc pic from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Midnight_Commander_screenshot.png)

There I felt at home. Most of the key bindings were still the same, functional
keys were nicely documented right on the screen. And built-in editor had
a bit of syntax highlighting! What else do you need?!

My system had `LANG=ru_RU.KOI8-R` locale at the time. It did not have
any troubles with text files in English. Some functional keys on the
other hand were off-by-two in `urxvt`. But they were working fine on
`xterm`. So I used `xterm`.

`mcedit` did not support file encoding different from `LC_CTYPE` at the
time. In rare moments of dire need I used things like
[`luit`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luit) as a cheap hack to get
something edited. I could not get `iconv` tool to work right. Fun times.

## First attempt as vim

At some point I decided to build
[`LFS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_From_Scratch) as a way to
learn `Linux` internals.
When I built it for the first time I needed an editor at an early stage
of system preparation. I ended up trying `vim`. Maybe it was a default?
I don't remember.

I copied `.vimrc` from my previous distribution (`Alt Master 2.2`, a
`Mandrake` sibling). Here is it's full content:

```vimrc
" Begin .vimrc

set nocompatible
set bs=2
" set columns=80
set background=dark
set wrapmargin=8
syntax on
set ruler

set encoding=utf-8
set fenc=utf-8
set fencs=utf-8,koi8-r

set cindent
set shiftwidth=4

" End .vimrc
```

I had no idea what exactly the above config did. In hindsight it's worst
bit was the `set wrapmargin=8` option. In case you are not familiar with
that `vim` option: it inserts newlines in strings automatically as soon
as you get as close as 8 characters to the visible boundary of the
screen from the right. As in, it inserts newlines in different places
depending on size of your terminal. And I was not used to `vim` enough
to spot that it does this thing. I had to open files in `mcedit` later
to find the effect.

In my case the first casualty was `/etc/fstab`: it wrapped half the
mount options to the newline and I got an unbootable system. When I
figured that it was `vim` deed I decided it was too dangerous to use
as it silently corrupts files.

On top of that I did not like black `vim` background: it felt void.
Plus multiple editing modes confused me. I did not understand why you
have to print `<ESC>:qa!` and sometimes just `:qa!`. I did not do a
`vimtutor` as I did not know it existed: I did not pay much attention to
various help banners `vim` pops at you at start.

Being a default editor in the distribution it felt like a handicap
archaic tool. I though it was not supposed to be a complete editor with
a long list of features. Ironically I thought it's something primitive
because it started up so quickly.

## First attempt at `emacs`

A bit later I got a day job related to `C++`. I started exploring
IDE-like environments. I can only remember `Anjuta` and `Eclipse`. There
were a lot more I tried. They all were too slow and opinionated, needed
project files, did not understand `autotools`-based projects. I quickly
rejected them all.

Around that time I got daily internet access where I found all sorts of
things about how cool `Lisp` and `Emacs` are. I started using `Emacs`
for most of file editing and read a few books on `Common Lisp`. I did
not write anything sizable in `Lisp`. Best I could do is to draw an
`OpenGL` rectangle using `verrazano` `FFI` library for `sbcl`.

In `C++` land I tried `ECB`, `CEDET` and `Bovinator` for parsing and
autocompletion. The result looked suboptimal (manly because our build
system injected too many defines external parsers did not know about).
The plugins slowed `emacs` loading a lot. To save on startup time I
tried to use `emacsclient`. I was using `X11` version of `Emacs`.
Switching workspace to edit a file was very inconvenient.

I disabled heavyweight extension and used `Emacs` itself for a while.

Writing this blog post I found that `emacsclient -nw` works just as
expected. It seems to do what I needed back then: it starts up quickly
as a client. Maybe I'll give `Emacs` another try as well. I'm so used to
it's key bindings in editor mode.

## Back to `mcedit`

Disappointed in slow `Emacs` start up times I settled on `mcedit` and
used it for most of my editing since. It looked perfect: so close to
`nc.exe`, trivial to extend syntax highlighting files with new keywords.
Apparently I even contributed
[`haskell.syntax`](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/commit/16130f7caa7381663fda8f57f5b46c2b716ec17f)
and [`ebuild.syntax`](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/commit/e0eb9ca1cd30cda67732096528e5573a14e5a1f4).

At that time a new `mc` development team was formed by Russian-speaking
community of `mc` users to revive stalled upstream development. I joined
and contributed a tiny bit to `mc`. I like to think I helped with
`subversion` to `git` migration, fixed a few dire corner cases in
completion code, fixed a few bugs in `FISH` file transfer protocol,
basic `alacritty` support and even support for compilation with
`tinycc`.

All the above helped me track and use new features in development in
`mcedit`: vertical block selection (`Alt-<arrows>`), tab/space
highlighting (`Alt-_`), file encoding selection (`Ctrl-e`), tag
completion (`ESC-Tab`) and many other things I take for granted today.
`mc` was my IDE for many years and `mcedit` helped editing all the text
files for me. Be it blog posts like this one, `Makefile`s, `C` projects,
`Haskell` projects, `/etc/fstab` entries. I even successfully patched
binary files with it.

## Various snags

There are many gnarly bits in `mc` and `mcedit`. Most of them stem from
the complex problem space. To name a few:

- `mc` is full of `terminfo` overrides (which are sometimes invalid and
  outdated) because distributions' `terminfo` databases are too old.
  Files like [`misc/mc.lib`](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/blob/master/misc/mc.lib)
  ought to be empty in a perfect system.
- `mc` has to interface with underlying shell (that you can access over
  `Ctrl-O`) by sending shell text commands like `cd $dir` when you move
  around directories and run executables. Path escaping and process
  progress is shell-dependent. State tracking is easy to confuse by
  running a subshell.
- `mcedit` has it's own (inefficient) syntax highlighter with it's own
  syntax file format. This means most language syntaxes have to be
  reimplemented on it. It's not too bad for simple languages. But very
  fragile for languages that allow you to embed another language in it's
  snippets: markdown with code snippets, shell with `$(subshell calls
  "strings $(more subshell)")`.
- `mcedit` while being a large part of `mc` is not the primary feature
  of it. `mc` is primarily a file manager that happens to have an
  editor. `mcedit` does not have that many contributors and lacks an
  easy way to extend it. Things like `tags` completion or `aspell`
  support are implemented directly in `C` code. There is no easy way to
  hack up a simple equivalent.

These are not major issues to get something basic to work. My use of
`mc` for past 20 years is a good indication of that.

Recently I went through the problems of [AoC 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015/)
just to practice in `rust` a bit more. I encountered a simple `json`
parsing problem (`2015/12`). It's
[input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trofi/AoC/main/2015/12/input)
is a single line of `json` text. The line was `37K` long. Tiny by today's
standards.

I selected the line in the browser and pressed `Shift+Insert` in
`mcedit` window to paste it.
Guess how long it took to insert the text into an otherwise empty
freshly opened file. 1 second? 10 seconds? 1 year? What would you
expect from your editor?

Got the guesstimate?

It took 40 seconds. What is worse: while pasting is in progress UI shows
you interactively the speed of text insertion (good). First `10K` got
inserted within 2-3 second, next `10K` took about 10 more seconds maybe,
and next 10K takes 25. This is quadratic behavior right there (bad).

I thought it's a minor bug. I knew `mc` does somewhat complex
arithmetic on multi-byte strings when moves around characters in them.
But it's not supposed to get that much worse.
I filed a [bug](https://midnight-commander.org/ticket/4421) with the
`perf` dump below to quickly highlight problematic bit:

```
  26,69%  mc                      [.] edit_buffer_get_utf
  25,02%  mc                      [.] edit_move_forward3
  14,99%  mc                      [.] edit_buffer_get_byte
   9,16%  libglib-2.0.so.0.7400.3 [.] g_utf8_get_char_validated
   5,51%  libglib-2.0.so.0.7400.3 [.] g_unichar_iswide
   4,33%  mc                      [.] edit_buffer_get_bol
   1,88%  mc                      [.] g_utf8_get_char_validated@plt
```

And got a response that such behaviour is not specific to `mcedit` and
should plague other editors as well. I though it sounded a bit wrong.
My expectation was that paste speed should be linear to pasted input,
not quadratic.

I tried to find at least one editor that would behave poorly for this
specific use case and found none. Anything I tried was able to do it in
1-2 seconds: `vim`, `emacs -nw`, `nano`, `gedit`, `geany`, `kwrite`,
`helix`, some `Java`-based editors I forgot. They all were reasonably
fast.

Unrelated to the above roughly around that time I planned to share one
of my blog posts to wider audience. I knew my text is always full of
typos and I wanted an easy interactive tool to highlight trivial typos
I did. I ran a few tools on my post and they all highlighted typos in
slightly different places: some looked at the code comment, some didn't,
some used external `aspell` engine, some used embedded grammar engines.
I settled on `vim`'s `:setlocal spell!` magic spell.

## vim again

Having got a bit of positive experience with spell checking I decided to
give `vim` another try. I did not want to write any complex
configuration as I have many editing environments and would prefer to be
able to get an editor into a comfortable state with a few commands or a
few lines in the config.

I went through my initial `~/.vimrc` from the ancient times to see if I
still needed any of that:

```
" Begin .vimrc

set nocompatible
set bs=2
" set columns=80
set background=dark
set wrapmargin=8
syntax on
set ruler

set encoding=utf-8
set fenc=utf-8
set fencs=utf-8,koi8-r

set cindent
set shiftwidth=4

" End .vimrc
```

I found that pesky `wrapmargin=8` option that inserted unexpected
newlines and disabled it as a first thing.

Then I looked around for a cozy background that `mcedit` and `nc` both
had. `colorscheme darkblue` did the trick.
I grew so fond of `mcedit` style of highlighting `<TAB>` and trailing
white space that I felt I absolutely needed an equivalent. Otherwise, I
would corrupt `Makefile`s all the time by expanding `<TAB>`s to spaces.
Or the other way around. Who knows!
White space highlighting was easy to do with `listchars`:

```
set list
set listchars=tab:<->,trail:.
```

Another important feature of `mcedit` was to preserve original
indentation for newly written lines. That I managed to get close enough
with the below:

```
" just maintain the indent
set autoindent

" copy the indentation style from previous line
set copyindent

" do preserve tab/space mix on change
set preserveindent
```

I still don't quite understand what `autoindent` does, but I get
something mostly reasonable.

Last minor thing that kept confusing me was indistinguishable command
prompt area. It was hard to tell if it's a command or the rest of edited
document. Thus, I added a few explicit visual delimiters with:

```
" always render tabs even if a single file is open
set showtabline=2

" always render status line below
set laststatus=2
```

To avoid inserting garbage when I use `Ctrl-<arrows>` out of old `Emacs`
/ `mcedit` habit I added a hack to recognize these keys in `tmux`:

```
" vim enables xterm-style Ctrl-<arrows> keys based on $TERM variable
" name. term=screen-256color does not trigger it. Let's work it around
" by clobbering it.
set term=xterm-256color
```

And that was it! I got good enough `vim` config as an `mcedit`
replacement. To clarity: they are absolutely not a drop-in replacement
at this point. They are now both comfortable enough for me to use.
I went through the `vimtutor` again, wrote a reasonably sized
[`nix-olde`](https://github.com/trofi/nix-olde/) program and got a
pleasant experience.

Along the way I found a few more advanced substitutes for `mcedit`
features:

- vertical block selectors are done via `Ctrl-v`
- adding/removing indent for selected lines are done via `Shift-,` /
  `Shift-.`.
- regex lookups and regex substitutes are occasionally helpful. They
  also work on visual selections and not just full files!

There are still things that I can't get used to so easily: I'm used to
INSERT mode that is always on in `mcedit` and `emacs`. I still keep
getting lost in which mode I am now and find myself to switch there and
back all the time. I'm not sure it's how it's supposed to work or I'm
doing `vim` wrong.

## Parting words

So far I'm using `vim` for a month and slowly discovering small bits
like `netrw` and tag completion. My
[~/.vimrc](https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/.vimrc) still fits
on one screen (if comments are removed).

I switched `claws-mail` from it's built-in `gtk` editor to external
`alacritty -e vim %s -c 'set filetype=mail' -c 'setlocal spell!'`
command. Now I'm actually enjoying writing emails. It's not a pain
anymore to paste large chunks of code with proper indentation or getting
through the spelling mistakes.

I also added [`vimium`](https://github.com/philc/vimium) extension in
`Firefox` to get nicer URL selection and input text navigation.

Maybe `vim` will stick this time.

Have fun!
