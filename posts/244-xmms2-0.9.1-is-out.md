Tl;DR: **xmms2-0.9.1** is out and you can get it at
<https://github.com/xmms2/xmms2-devel/releases/tag/0.9.1>!

[xmms2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMMS2) is a music player daemon
with various plugins to support stream decoding and transformation.

# xmms2 most basic usage

To play a song you need to add it to database and then play it:

```
$ xmms2 clear
$ xmms2 add .
$ xmms2 play
```

To check on current status:

```
$ xmms2 list
->[1/3096] mind.in.a.box - Lament for Lost Dreams (snippet) (00:26)

Total playtime: 0:00:26

$ xmms2 status

   (n) jump to next song
   (p) jump to previous song
   (SPACE) toggle playback
   (ENTER) exit status mode

Paused: mind.in.a.box - Lament for Lost Dreams (snippet): 00:05 of 00:26
```

**xmms2** CLI has many more options:

```
xmms2 help
usage: xmms2 <command> [args]

Available commands:
   add
   current
   exit
   help
   info
   jump
   list
   move
   next
   pause
   play
   prev
   remove
   stop
   search
   seek
   toggle
   collection <subcommand>
   playlist <subcommand>
   server <subcommand>

Type 'help <command>' for detailed help about a command.
```

You really want some frontend to manipulate the player.

I usually run a shell wrapper in a directory I want to play.
Effectively I'm using my window manager as a frontend:

- **mc** in **alacritty** to run **m** in a directory I want to play: [script](https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/.bash/funs#L19)
- **i3** key bindings to navigate through song and playlist: [config](https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/.config/i3/config#L30)
- **xmobar** (with [a formatter](https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/bin/player-status-entry-persist.py)) as a status output.

# why xmms2?

My path to **xmms2** was fun. My first audio player program was
[winamp 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp#Winamp_2) on windows 98.
When I switched to linux I picked closest alternative (and even brought
my favourite hacker skin). It was [xmms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMMS).

**xmms** was a good player. But it's upstream development stalled. It
was using **gtk-1** at the time when everyone else was migrating to
**gtk-2**. A bunch of **gtk-2** forks appeared and none looked close
enough to **xmms**. Some had too thick UI buttons, some had problems
playing enough audio formats I had. Most did not support **xmms** skins
and were not able to present their status as a 16-pixel high window
somewhere on the desktop.

**xmms2** was a new project that aimed to be **xmms** done right
architecturally. I read the initial announcement at the
time and though it will eventually be just like **xmms**. Haha. I tried
**xmms2** out and was able to play all song formats I had. I was surprised
to see how quickly it builds from source.

**xmms2** felt incomplete as it planned but never implemented GUI
client. Eventually **abraca** materialized but I never got to run
it: I already settled on my set of CLI hacks to play things.

Eventually **xmms2** development pace was slowing down. I was wondering
if there are any direct alternatives to **xmms2** out there. **mpd**
looked like a close match. But when I tried it I found **xmms2**
snappier to add files to the database and to scroll along the playlists
with **i3** keybindings. I suspect **mpd** was not optimised for that
use case. I never moved off **xmms2**. I still plan to add **UNI** module
file format support to **xmms2** via **libmikmod** or similar :)
