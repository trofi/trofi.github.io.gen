Welcome, internet wanderer!

Here I occasionally [blog](/blog.html) about the things I encounter.
Mostly for general amusement. My area of interest is CPU architectures
and toolchains supporting them. I know a little bit about
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux),
[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and
[Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell).

For shorter and more volatile updates you might want to check out
[`@trofi@fosstodon.org`](https://fosstodon.org/@trofi). I also
occasionally post a stream of amusing bugs or fixes in the
[log](/log.html) page.

Enjoy!
