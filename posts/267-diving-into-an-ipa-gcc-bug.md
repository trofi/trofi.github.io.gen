title: "Diving into an IPA gcc bug"
date: November 19, 2022
---

`gcc` has a nice set of optimizations based on inter-procedural
analysis (`IPA`). Some of them are simpler (like `early-inliner`),
and some are fancier (like `ipa-modref`). Their positive (and negative)
effect is most pronounced when applied to a program as a whole (`LTO`
builds).

Naturally occasional bugs creep in every now and then. They are rare
enough and non-trivial enough that I forget almost everything when
another one pops up.

I'll use [`PR107661`](https://gcc.gnu.org/PR107661) as a running example
to explore some details of `ipa-cp` pass and write down the process of
chasing the bug. We'll have a glance at mechanics of trimming down the
example, at mechanics of `ipa-cp` pass run on a simple example and at
the bug itself.

I hope this doc will be useful to others and maybe future me.
It's a long read. You have been warned.

## The bug effect

After another weekly `gcc` update I found that `llvm-12` (and `llvm-11`)
test suites started failing 4 tests. All tests normally pass as `llvm`
test suite is quite self-contained: inputs are in `llvm` assembly and
outputs are in `llvm` internal representation. No external tools are
required. Thus, any regressions in `llvm` tests are either latent `llvm`
bugs (unlikely) or bugs in a host compiler (more likely, `gcc-13` in my
case). I usually assume the latter. This time `llvm-12` failed these 4
tests as reported by `make check`:

```
$ nix build -L --impure --expr 'with import ~/n {}; llvmPackages_12.override { stdenv = gccGitStdenv; }'
...
Failed Tests (4):
  LLVM :: CodeGen/AMDGPU/GlobalISel/llvm.amdgcn.div.fmas.ll
  LLVM :: CodeGen/AMDGPU/atomic_optimizations_pixelshader.ll
  LLVM :: CodeGen/AMDGPU/smem-war-hazard.mir
  LLVM :: CodeGen/AMDGPU/vgpr-descriptor-waterfall-loop-idom-update.ll
```

## Example failing test

Test suite log pointed at this command as a failure trigger:

```
$ bin/llc < ../test/CodeGen/AMDGPU/vgpr-descriptor-waterfall-loop-idom-update.ll \
    -march=amdgcn -mcpu=gfx1010 | bin/FileCheck --allow-unused-prefixes=false \
        ../test/CodeGen/AMDGPU/vgpr-descriptor-waterfall-loop-idom-update.ll --check-prefix=GCN
```

I ran this test manually. Sometimes it failed, sometimes it succeeded!

The failure was non-deterministic. I hoped for use of uninitialized value
somewhere in `llvm` code. Any attempt to build `llvm-12` with
`-fsanitize=address` or `-fsanitize=undefined` made the bug to go away
without any error reports. Not good. Hard to draw any conclusions.

## Nailing down suspect source file

The next step was to find the file that likely got miscompiled: I kept
adding `#pragma GCC optimize(0)` to various `AMDGPU` files until bug
disappeared. Then I removed as many added pragmas as I could to find
minimum amount needed to fix the test. One file was enough:
`llvm/lib/Target/AMDGPU/GCNHazardRecognizer.cpp`. bug disappeared
when I added the pragma to only that file. Guessing the right file took a
few attempts but it was not hard.

Then I started moving functions from `GCNHazardRecognizer.cpp` (built
with `-O0`) out into another `.cpp` file (built with `-O3`) one by one
to narrow the set of functions to minimum amount when the bug is still
present. At some point
`valgrind` started complaining at `llc` for use of uninitialized value.
The precise report did not make sense: there were no uninitialized
variables in `c++` code.
Backtraces contained lines from `GCNHazardRecognizer.cpp`, but only when
`llc` was built with `-O3`. `-O0` had no complains from `valgrind`. I
hoped it was a real bug and not a `valgrind` deficiency.

At that point I had more reproducible example. This allowed me to shrink
`vgpr-descriptor-waterfall-loop-idom-update.ll` example down to 2 lines
of `llvm` assembly code while keeping `valgrind` complaining.

From that point I could understand what `llvm` input I am compiling and
what checks does `GCNHazardRecognizer.cpp` attempt to perform: the pass
tested register conflicts and did not modify the input program. That's
a nice property: we can remove various parts of the validator without
fear of breaking the whole compilation process.

## Trimming down the source

Even with most functions removed `GCNHazardRecognizer.cpp` still
contained `24KB` of `C++` with many local and `STL` includes. It was very
hard to explore what `gcc` was doing wrong to such a large input.

I started removing unused code by adding `__builtin_trap()` into
functions and making sure that code does not get executed (when `llc`
ran successfully). This allowed me to shrink `GCNHazardRecognizer.cpp`
down to `10KB` of `C++` code.

## Trimming down optimization options

After I could remove no other function from `GCNHazardRecognizer.cpp`
I reduced optimization level from `-O3` down to `-O1 -fipa-cp -fipa-cp-clone`.

I got the list of options to try from `gcc -O3 -Q --help=optimizers`
output where `gcc` tells us actual effect of `-O3` aggregate option
in terms of more fine-grained individual `-f*` and `--param=*` options.

## Deoptimizing the source

Then I started adding `__attribute__((noinline, noipa))` (or
`__attribute__((noclone))` if `noipa` was too much) to every function
used in `GCNHazardRecognizer.cpp`. This included common `llvm` header
files. That way I could reduce amount of transformations `gcc` does
with input file. I used `-fopt-info` reports to pick next function to
deoptimize, or inline manually if it's required to trigger the bug.

This step took a while as I had to sprinkle many parts of `llvm` common
header code.

The result allowed me to remove vast majority of tiny helper functions
from
optimizer's oversight. Some functions I was able to turn into no-op
functions just to maintain the call graph: so that I could keep code
execution flow roughly the same.

## Getting self-contained example

From that point I could extract the result into a single `.cpp` file.
I filed a [`PR107661`](https://gcc.gnu.org/PR107661) form the result
hoping that the bug would be obvious to an expert.

The resulting test was still a bit cryptic. I'm not posting it here as
we can do a bit better before looking at what compiler does with it.

## Removing most syntactic sugar

Then I expanded high level `c++` constructs like lambda functions and
classes into structs and explicit method names, inlined methods manually
and removed unused parameters. In this case I especially was afraid of
`function_ref` class used in original file: it used very unusual way to
capture lambda context. I was not sure it conforms to `C++` semantics.

In the example below we just pass a function pointer with seemingly no
opportunity of undefined behavior.

```c
// #define DISABLE_HACK 1

#include <stdio.h>

static void L_run(void) { fprintf(stderr, "BAD\n"); }
static void callback_fn_L(void) { L_run(); }
static void callback_fn_R(void) { fprintf(stderr, "GOOD\n"); }

struct function_ref {
  void (*callback)(void);
};

// allow one level of recursion to call callback twice
static int is_recur(void) {
  static int n = 0;
  switch (n++) {
    case 0: return 1;
    default: return 0;
  }
}

static void do3(volatile int * punused, function_ref Expired) {
  Expired.callback();

  if (is_recur())
    do3(punused, Expired);
}

static void do1(function_ref Expired) {
  volatile int unused = 42;

  do3(&unused, Expired);
}

int main(void) { do1(function_ref{callback_fn_R}); }

#if defined(DISABLE_HACK)
#else
void seemingly_unused_foo(void) { do1(function_ref{callback_fn_L}); }
#endif
```

This example behaves differently when `void seemingly_unused_foo(void)`
is present and is absent in the code:

```
$ ./gcc-13-snap/bin/gcc -O1 -fipa-cp -fipa-cp-clone                a.cc -o a && ./a
GOOD
BAD
$ ./gcc-13-snap/bin/gcc -O1 -fipa-cp -fipa-cp-clone -DDISABLE_HACK a.cc -o a && ./a
GOOD
GOOD
```

Note how executable output changes from `GOOD/BAD` to `GOOD/GOOD`. It's not
supposed to and `gcc-12` never prints `BAD` text.

## Making sure not many optimization opportunities are left

Once we have a self-contained example it's useful to apply (or disable)
most unrelated optimizations. Once again I usually use `-fopt-info` for
that.

Running it against our current example reports just one transformation:

```
$ gcc -O1 -fipa-cp -fipa-cp-clone -fopt-info -c a.cc -o a.o
a.cc:31:19: optimized: converting indirect call in void do3.constprop(volatile int*, function_ref)/24 to direct call to void callback_fn_L()/13
```

Here we see that `gcc` did something to `do3()` to optimize indirect
`Expired.callback();` call into direct `callback_fn_L()` call. That is
probably done to optimize `seemingly_unused_foo()` as nothing else is
expected to call `callback_fn_L()`.

While we are at it there are cases when you expect some optimization to
fire. But for some reason it does not happen.`-fopt-info-all` might
shed some light into decisions made by `gcc`:

```
$ gcc -O1 -fipa-cp -fipa-cp-clone -fopt-info-all -c a.cc -o a.o

Unit growth for small function inlining: 82->82 (0%)

Inlined 4 calls, eliminated 1 functions
```

Here we see all sorts of rejected inline attempts. From what I
understand `-O1` only implies `-finline-functions-called-once`
but not `-finline-functions` (`-O2` default). That means `inline`
keyword (or a single-call `static` function call) is the usual
trigger for inlining decision.

## A simpler constant propagation example

Before chasing specifics of our breakage let's look at a simpler
valid case of constant propagation across procedures. Let's try the
following contrived example:

```c
/* Forbid inlining to see the cloning effect */
__attribute__((noinline))
static int f(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

/* Add one level of indirection to force IPA discover f(..., 10) */
__attribute__((noinline))
static int g(int a, int b) {
    return f(a, b);
}

int main(void) {
  volatile int i = 42;
  return g(i, 10);
}
```

![](/posts.data/267-diving-into-an-ipa-gcc-bug/example-1.svg)

Here we define `f(int a, int b)` and `g(int a, int b)` function that
ever see `b = 10` value as their second argument. Will `gcc` do
something about that redundancy? We also mark both functions `noinline`
to prevent `gcc` from just inlining everything into `main()`.

Building and running it:

```
$ gcc -O3 a.c -o a && ./a
$ echo $?
52
```

The program prints `42 + 10 = 52` as expected. Let's look at the `IPA`
details to trace through its workings. I'll use `-fdump-ipa-cp-slim`
to dump pass internal state and decisions:

```
$ gcc -O3 -c a.c -fdump-ipa-cp-slim
$ cat a.c.081i.cp
```

I'll paste `a.c.081i.cp` in pieces and add a few comments around:

```
IPA constant propagation start:

IPA structures before propagation:

Jump functions:
  Jump functions of caller  main/2:
    callsite  main/2 -> g/1 :
       param 0: UNKNOWN
         value: 0x0, mask: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
         Unknown VR
       param 1: CONST: 10
         value: 0xa, mask: 0x0
         Unknown VR
  Jump functions of caller  g/1:
    callsite  g/1 -> f/0 :
       param 0: PASS THROUGH: 0, op nop_expr
         value: 0x0, mask: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
         Unknown VR
       param 1: PASS THROUGH: 1, op nop_expr
         value: 0x0, mask: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
         Unknown VR
  Jump functions of caller  f/0:
```

This is the list of initial facts about our program before the
optimization:

- `f()` does not call any other function
- `g()` calls `f()`, it has 2 parameters and both get passed as is to `f()`
- `main()` calls `g()`:
  * param0 has unknown value
  * param1 has known value `10` (`0xa`). Why `mask:` value is so large? An exercise for the reader.

Next step is to figure out if known constants propagate to callees in
any interesting way:

```
 Propagating constants:


overall_size: 20
 - context independent values, size: 6, time_benefit: 1.000000
     Decided to specialize for all known contexts, code not going to grow.
 - context independent values, size: 3, time_benefit: 1.000000
     Decided to specialize for all known contexts, code not going to grow.

IPA lattices after all propagation:

Lattices:
  Node: main/2:
  Node: g/1:
    param [0]: VARIABLE
         ctxs: VARIABLE
         Bits unusable (BOTTOM)
         int VARYING
        AGGS VARIABLE
    param [1]: 10 [loc_time: 0, loc_size: 0, prop_time: 0, prop_size: 0]
         ctxs: VARIABLE
         Bits: value = 0xa, mask = 0x0
         int [10, 10]
        AGGS VARIABLE
  Node: f/0:
    param [0]: VARIABLE
         ctxs: VARIABLE
         Bits unusable (BOTTOM)
         int VARYING
        AGGS VARIABLE
    param [1]: 10 [loc_time: 0, loc_size: 0, prop_time: 0, prop_size: 0]
         ctxs: VARIABLE
         Bits: value = 0xa, mask = 0x0
         int [10, 10]
        AGGS VARIABLE

```

Here propagation step figured out extra facts:

- `f()`'s parameters are a bit more definite:
  * param0 is still unknown (`BOTTOM`)
  * param1 always has value `10`
- `g()`'s parameters have exactly the same structure as `f()`'s:
  * param0 is still unknown (`BOTTOM`)
  * param1 always has value `10`
- `main()` has nothing special about its parameters

`prop_time: 0, prop_size: 0` tell us that possible constant propagation
does not worsen runtime of the original code.

Then goes the decision phase:

```
IPA decision stage:

 - Creating a specialized node of g/1 for all known contexts.
    replacing param #1 b with const 10
 - Creating a specialized node of f/0 for all known contexts.
    replacing param #1 b with const 10
Propagated bits info for function f.constprop/4:
 param 1: value = 0xa, mask = 0x0
Propagated bits info for function g.constprop/3:
 param 1: value = 0xa, mask = 0x0
Propagated bits info for function g/1:
 param 1: value = 0xa, mask = 0x0
Propagated bits info for function f/0:
 param 1: value = 0xa, mask = 0x0

IPA constant propagation end
```

As expected `f()` and `g()` were replaced when equivalent functions
where their second parameter is always equals `10`. After the
transformation original `f()` and `g()` are no used anymore and can go
away. Call graph becomes slightly more complicated:

```
;; Function f.constprop (f.constprop.0, funcdef_no=3, decl_uid=2004, cgraph_uid=5, symbol_order=4) (executed once)

Modification phase of node f.constprop/4
__attribute__((noinline))
int f.constprop (int a)
{
  int b;
  int _2;

  <bb 3> [local count: 1073741824]:

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  _2 = a_1(D) + 10;
  return _2;

}

;; Function g.constprop (g.constprop.0, funcdef_no=4, decl_uid=2003, cgraph_uid=4, symbol_order=3) (executed once)

Modification phase of node g.constprop/3
__attribute__((noinline))
int g.constprop (int a)
{
  int b;
  int _2;

  <bb 3> [local count: 1073741824]:

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  _2 = f (a_1(D), 10);
  return _2;

}

;; Function main (main, funcdef_no=2, decl_uid=1987, cgraph_uid=3, symbol_order=2) (executed once)

Modification phase of node main/2
int main ()
{
  volatile int i;
  int i.0_1;
  int _4;

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  i ={v} 42;
  i.0_1 ={v} i;
  _4 = g (i.0_1, 10);
  return _4;

}
```

Note how this pass turned `int f(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` into
`int f.constprop(int a) { return a + 10; }`. While `g.constprop()` and
`main()` still do call 2-parameter forms of `f()` and `g()` in the
report.

Luckily that is not the final pass! If we look at final state at
`a.c.252t.optimized` (generated by
`gcc -O3 -c a.c -fdump-tree-optimized-slim`):


```
__attribute__((noinline))
int f.constprop (int a)
{
  int _2;

  <bb 2>:
  _2 = a_1(D) + 10;
  return _2;
}

__attribute__((noinline))
int g.constprop (int a)
{
  int _2;
  <bb 2>:
  _2 = f.constprop (a_1(D)); [tail call]
  return _2;
}

int main ()
{
  volatile int i;
  int i.0_1;
  int _4;

  <bb 2>:
  i ={v} 42;
  i.0_1 ={v} i;
  _4 = g.constprop (i.0_1); [tail call]
  return _4;
}
```

Or the same in more concise form:

![](/posts.data/267-diving-into-an-ipa-gcc-bug/example-2.svg)

All function are single-parameter now. `b = 10` was pushed all the way
down to `f.constprop()` definition.

## Tracking down faulty subsystem

Now back to our buggy example: why did `BAD` get printed at all? I had
no idea. Generated assembly code did not make sense.

First I bisected `gcc` to see if the change was small enough to
immediately see the bug. Bisect found regression in big
[`ipa-cp`: Better representation of aggregate values we clone for](https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=e0403e95689af7)
commit: `5 files changed, 733 insertions(+), 666 deletions(-)`.
The commit is not supposed to bring in any visible changes to
the algorithm used. It should only improve `gcc` efficiency a bit
without any change in the output. The diff in commit was too large for
me to understand. I had no idea what I was looking at.

I moved to inspect `gcc` transformation stages. Each individual
optimization pass is usually simple enough that we can manually
verify if it's effect is correct. At least for me that works only
for small input source files.

`gcc` pass debugging steps hide under `-fdump-*` flags. Most
frequent flags I use are:

- `-fdump-tree-all` (or similar `-fdump-tree-all-all`, `-fdump-tree-all-slim` that differ in verbosity)
- `-fdump-ipa-all` (or `-fdump-ipa-all-all` and `-fdump-ipa-all-slim`)
- `-fdump-rtl-all` (or `-fdump-rtl-all-all` and `-fdump-ipa-rtl-slim`)

`gcc` man page defines many more output formats and suffix meanings.

Building the example with `-fdump-tree-all-slim` creates many files
including `a.cc.254t.optimized` of this content:

```
;; Function callback_fn_R (_ZL13callback_fn_Rv, funcdef_no=14, decl_uid=3302, cgraph_uid=15, symbol_order=14)
void callback_fn_R ()
{
  struct FILE * stderr.0_1;

  <bb 2>:
  stderr.0_1 = stderr;
  __builtin_fwrite ("GOOD\n", 1, 5, stderr.0_1);
  return;

}

;; Function L_run (_ZL5L_runv, funcdef_no=12, decl_uid=3298, cgraph_uid=13, symbol_order=12)
void L_run ()
{
  struct FILE * stderr.5_1;

  <bb 2>:
  stderr.5_1 = stderr;
  __builtin_fwrite ("BAD\n", 1, 4, stderr.5_1);
  return;

}
;; Function do3.constprop (_ZL3do3PVi12function_ref.constprop.0, funcdef_no=21, decl_uid=3391, cgraph_uid=23, symbol_order=24)
void do3.constprop (volatile int * punused, struct function_ref Expired)
{
  int _2;

  <bb 2>:
  L_run ();
  _2 = is_recur ();
  if (_2 != 0)
    goto <bb 3>; [33.00%]
  else
    goto <bb 4>; [67.00%]

  <bb 3>:
  do3.constprop (punused_3(D), Expired);

  <bb 4>:
  return;

}

;; Function main (main, funcdef_no=18, decl_uid=3357, cgraph_uid=19, symbol_order=19) (executed once)
int main ()
{
  struct function_ref Expired;
  volatile int unused;
  int _5;

  <bb 2>:
  unused ={v} 42;
  Expired.callback = callback_fn_R;
  callback_fn_R ();
  _5 = is_recur ();
  if (_5 != 0)
    goto <bb 3>; [33.00%]
  else
    goto <bb 4>; [67.00%]

  <bb 3>:
  do3.constprop (&unused, Expired);

  <bb 4>:
  return 0;

}
...
void seemingly_unused_foo ()
{
  volatile int unused;
  struct function_ref Expired;

  Expired.callback = callback_fn_L;
  unused ={v} 42;
  do3.constprop (&unused, Expired);
  return;
}
```

While it's a lot of text it's almost identical source program we wrote.
The only difference is verbosity: explicit assignments instead of
constructors, explicit label jumps and similar.

Having skimmed through it we can spot a few curious things:

- `do3()` disappeared completely. `do3.constprop()` is the only one left
  and it calls only `L_run()` (from `callback_fn_L`). There is no
  `callback_fn_R` call.
- `seemingly_unused_foo()` calls `do3.constprop()` directly (ok).
- `main()` calls `callback_fn_R()` directly (ok) and calls `do3.constprop()`
  (bug!).
- `do1()` was completely optimized away by inlining into
  `main()` and `seemingly_unused_foo()`.

Let's look at the output of `IPA` phases instead. I used
`-fdump-ipa-all-slim` to generate the logs. Among other things
it generates `a.cc.081i.cp` file:

```

A lot more text that before. Here `IPA` pass tells us a bit of inferred
state out of our program and then applies some transformations to it.

The above output tells us that `do3()` was cloned into `do3.constprop()`
with explicit call of `_1 = callback_fn_L; _1 ();` and nothing else.
According to modified functions output `do3.constprop()` is not used in
anywhere.

But that is misleading: symbol table is clearly telling us the reverse:
`_ZL3do3PVi12function_ref.constprop.0/24` (aka `do3.constprop()`)
`Called by: _ZL3do3PVi12function_ref/17` (aka `do3()`),
 `_ZL3do3PVi12function_ref.constprop.0/24` (aka `do3.constprop()`),
`_ZL3do112function_ref.constprop.0/23` (aka `do1.constprop()`).

The most suspicious output here is presence of
`do3() -> do3.constprop()` edge. How could `do3()` call
`do3.constprop()`? The line
`- adding an extra caller void do3(volatile int*, function_ref)/17 of void do3.constprop(volatile int*, function_ref)/24`
in the log is a good hint where to look at the details in `gcc` source
code.

Anyway, the resulting printed code is not directly broken. So far it's
"only" edge information that looks incorrect. Maybe I am misinterpreting
it?

Now let's look at the next `a.cc.085i.inline` `IPA` step:

Here we can see how problematic edges discovered in `cp` phase broke
`inline`: `main()` function now calls `do3.constprop ();` (after `do3()`
inline) and that encodes `L_run ();` call to print `BAD`.

## Diving into `ipa-cp`

Now let's try to figure out why does `ipa-cp` add a problematic
`do3() -> do3.constprop()` edge.

`gcc` frequently has great comments in the source code on details of
what a pass is supposed to do. `ipa-cp` is no exception: it hides
in [`gcc/ipa-cp.cc` file](<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=gcc/ipa-cp.cc;h=d2bcd5e5e691ced8dba4b496b9d044eb2777d2b2;hb=HEAD#l23):

```
  23 /* Interprocedural constant propagation (IPA-CP).
  24 
  25    The goal of this transformation is to
  26 
  27    1) discover functions which are always invoked with some arguments with the
  28       same known constant values and modify the functions so that the
  29       subsequent optimizations can take advantage of the knowledge, and
  30 
  31    2) partial specialization - create specialized versions of functions
  32       transformed in this way if some parameters are known constants only in
  33       certain contexts but the estimated tradeoff between speedup and cost size
  34       is deemed good.
  35 
  36    The algorithm also propagates types and attempts to perform type based
  37    devirtualization.  Types are propagated much like constants.
  38 
  39    The algorithm basically consists of three stages.  In the first, functions
  40    are analyzed one at a time and jump functions are constructed for all known
  41    call-sites.  In the second phase, the pass propagates information from the
  42    jump functions across the call to reveal what values are available at what
  43    call sites, performs estimations of effects of known values on functions and
  44    their callees, and finally decides what specialized extra versions should be
  45    created.  In the third, the special versions materialize and appropriate
  46    calls are redirected.
  47 
  48    The algorithm used is to a certain extent based on "Interprocedural Constant
  49    Propagation", by David Callahan, Keith D Cooper, Ken Kennedy, Linda Torczon,
  50    Comp86, pg 152-161 and "A Methodology for Procedure Cloning" by Keith D
  51    Cooper, Mary W. Hall, and Ken Kennedy.
  52 
  53 
  54    First stage - intraprocedural analysis
  55    =======================================
  56 
  57    This phase computes jump_function and modification flags.
  58 
  59    A jump function for a call-site represents the values passed as an actual
  60    arguments of a given call-site. In principle, there are three types of
  61    values:
  62 
  63    Pass through - the caller's formal parameter is passed as an actual
  64                   argument, plus an operation on it can be performed.
  65    Constant - a constant is passed as an actual argument.
  66    Unknown - neither of the above.
  67 
  68    All jump function types are described in detail in ipa-prop.h, together with
  69    the data structures that represent them and methods of accessing them.
  70 
  71    ipcp_generate_summary() is the main function of the first stage.
  72 
  73    Second stage - interprocedural analysis
  74    ========================================
  75 
  76    This stage is itself divided into two phases.  In the first, we propagate
  77    known values over the call graph, in the second, we make cloning decisions.
  78    It uses a different algorithm than the original Callahan's paper.
  79 
  80    First, we traverse the functions topologically from callers to callees and,
  81    for each strongly connected component (SCC), we propagate constants
  82    according to previously computed jump functions.  We also record what known
  83    values depend on other known values and estimate local effects.  Finally, we
  84    propagate cumulative information about these effects from dependent values
  85    to those on which they depend.
  86 
  87    Second, we again traverse the call graph in the same topological order and
  88    make clones for functions which we know are called with the same values in
  89    all contexts and decide about extra specialized clones of functions just for
  90    some contexts - these decisions are based on both local estimates and
  91    cumulative estimates propagated from callees.
  92 
  93    ipcp_propagate_stage() and ipcp_decision_stage() together constitute the
  94    third stage.
  95 
  96    Third phase - materialization of clones, call statement updates.
  97    ============================================
  98 
  99    This stage is currently performed by call graph code (mainly in cgraphunit.cc
 100    and tree-inline.cc) according to instructions inserted to the call graph by
 101    the second stage.  */
```

The idea is straightforward:

- collect all the call sites with their parameters (constant parameters
  are most interesting to propagate them into callees)
- sort the call graph topologically
- estimate propagation effect (cost reduction)
- clone functions by applying propagated constants where it's beneficial
- patch call sites to use clones instead of original functions

While the whole algorithm might be overwhelming each of its step is not
too big to trace it through for our concrete example.

In theory `ipa-cp` should perform a transformation similar to the following:

![](/posts.data/267-diving-into-an-ipa-gcc-bug/fig-1.svg)

I expected callback `cb` indirection to be fully specialized and
runtime indirection to completely go away.

In practice something like the following occurs:

![](/posts.data/267-diving-into-an-ipa-gcc-bug/fig-2.svg)

Note: `main()` manages to both inline `GOOD` callback and call
specialized `do1.constprop()` `BAD` branch. The edge marked with `Bug!`
is the actual bug here.

To summarize the `ipa-cp` pass once again it consists of 3 steps:

- collect information around known call sites of the functions
  ("jump functions")
- calculate propagation information around known calls to see how far
  they reach unmodified and how many functions get always called with
  the same arguments ("constant propagation")
- generate specialized function clones and redirect matching call sites
  to the clones ("decision")

Let's look in more detail at our example to find out what specifically
went wrong. I'll post code snippet again:

```c
// #define DISABLE_HACK 1

#include <stdio.h>

static void L_run(void) { fprintf(stderr, "BAD\n"); }
static void callback_fn_L(void) { L_run(); }
static void callback_fn_R(void) { fprintf(stderr, "GOOD\n"); }

struct function_ref {
  void (*callback)(void);
};

// allow one level of recursion to call callback twice
static int is_recur(void) {
  static int n = 0;
  switch (n++) {
    case 0: return 1;
    default: return 0;
  }
}

static void do3(volatile int * punused, function_ref Expired) {
  Expired.callback();

  if (is_recur())
    do3(punused, Expired);
}

static void do1(function_ref Expired) {
  volatile int unused = 42;

  do3(&unused, Expired);
}

int main(void) { do1(function_ref{callback_fn_R}); }

#if defined(DISABLE_HACK)
#else
void seemingly_unused_foo(void) { do1(function_ref{callback_fn_L}); }
#endif
```

And relevant analysis again:

```
IPA lattices after all propagation:

Lattices:

    param [0]: VARIABLE

               callback_fn_R [loc_time: 9, loc_size: 13, prop_time: 9, prop_size: 13]

...
IPA decision stage:

  Creating a specialized node of void do1(function_ref)/18.
  Creating a specialized node of void do3(volatile int*, function_ref)/17.
ipa-prop: Discovered an indirect call to a known target (void do3.constprop(volatile int*, function_ref)/24 -> void callback_fn_L()/13), for stmt _1 ();
 - adding an extra caller void do3(volatile int*, function_ref)/17 of void do3.constprop(volatile int*, function_ref)/24
```

Here propagation phase correctly sees that `do3()` sees two constants
being passed as parameters: `callback_fn_L()` and `callback_fn_R()`.

Thus, whatever `do3.constprop()` is specialized against `do3()` can't call
into it on it's own: `do3()` has to work for `callback_fn_L()` and `callback_fn_R()`
inputs.

If we look at `adding an extra caller` string in `gcc` source code we
will see the condition on which `gcc` decided it's OK
[in perhaps_add_new_callers()](https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=gcc/ipa-cp.cc;h=d5230c7c5e6b150f7ac9e1a1445178239dc67c39;hb=603af25815523ba9e39e9b441cde5308423a9238#l5918):

```

Given that we pass a `struct { ... }` as a parameter our condition that
should have failed lives at `cgraph_edge_brings_all_agg_vals_for_node (cs, val->spec_node)`
call. It is supposed to check that all the parameters that our `d3.constprop()`
is specialized against is enough to cover all the call sites.

`cgraph_edge_brings_all_agg_vals_for_node()` just implements that:
`avl` contains all values from seen edges while `existing` contains
values `node` is specialized against. Adding simple
`avl.dump (stderr); existing.dump (stderr);` shows the discrepancy.

A bit of extra debugging revealed that `push_agg_values_from_edge()` is
slightly broken. It handles self-recursive functions like
`d3()`: instead of extending already known values extracted from
specialized node (passed as `&existing`) it just reuses `&existing`
value as if no other information is present.

The workaround to test the theory was simple: just drop this pre-seed.

 }
```

That was enough to repair this test and `llvm-11` and `llvm-12` test
suite. The actual fix is slightly less conservative and uses `&existing`
values in propagation phase when edge values are not fully discovered
yet.

Martin did a proper fix in
[`ipa-cp`: Do not be too optimistic about self-recursive edges](https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=c4a92a9117a034e7cf291ae51d8b9b844fb5a88b)
commit.

## Optimized example after the fix

Here is the final state built with `gcc -O1 -fipa-cp -fipa-cp-clone a.cc -o a -fdump-tree-all-slim`:

```
void do3 (volatile int * punused, struct function_ref Expired)
{
  static int n = <<< omitted >>>;
  void (*<T545>) (void) _1;
  int n.3_9;
  int _10;

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  _1 = Expired.callback;
  _1 ();
  n.3_9 = n;
  _10 = n.3_9 + 1;
  n = _10;
  if (n.3_9 == 0)
    goto <bb 3>; [33.00%]
  else
    goto <bb 4>; [67.00%]

  <bb 3> [local count: 354334800]:
  do3 (punused_7(D), Expired);

  <bb 4> [local count: 1073741824]:
  return;
}

void callback_fn_R ()
{
  struct FILE * stderr.0_1;

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  stderr.0_1 = stderr;
  __builtin_fwrite ("GOOD\n", 1, 5, stderr.0_1);
  return;
}

void L_run ()
{
  struct FILE * stderr.5_1;

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  stderr.5_1 = stderr;
  __builtin_fwrite ("BAD\n", 1, 4, stderr.5_1);
  return;
}

void callback_fn_L ()
{
  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  L_run ();
  return;
}

void do3.constprop (volatile int * punused, struct function_ref Expired)
{
  static int n = <<< omitted >>>;
  int n.3_9;
  int _10;

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  L_run ();
  n.3_9 = n;
  _10 = n.3_9 + 1;
  n = _10;
  if (n.3_9 == 0)
    goto <bb 3>; [33.00%]
  else
    goto <bb 4>; [67.00%]

  <bb 3> [local count: 354334800]:
  do3.constprop (punused_3(D), Expired);

  <bb 4> [local count: 1073741824]:
  return;
}

int main ()
{
  volatile int unused;
  struct function_ref Expired;

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  Expired.callback = callback_fn_R;
  unused ={v} 42;
  do3 (&unused, Expired);
  Expired ={v} {CLOBBER(eol)};
  return 0;
}

void seemingly_unused_foo ()
{
  volatile int unused;
  struct function_ref Expired;

  <bb 2> [local count: 1073741824]:
  Expired.callback = callback_fn_L;
  unused ={v} 42;
  do3.constprop (&unused, Expired);
  Expired ={v} {CLOBBER(eol)};
  return;
}
```

We see both `do3()` used by `main()` and `do3.constprop()` used by
`seemingly_unused_foo()`. I don't understand why `main()` did not
trigger specialization of another `do3()` variant. Let it be another
exercise for the reader and optimization opportunity :)

## Parting words

`llvm` tests caught another non-trivial `gcc` bug.

`ipa` bugs are somewhat hard to reduce down to single file examples
without at least minimum amount of understanding what `gcc` does and
what it does not to the source file. `-fopt-info` helps a lot in that.

Reduction process is mostly mechanical and does not require too much
creativity. If I could do it so can you. Manual reduction and helped
me to get some feeling what various `gcc` passes do to the source
program: how lambdas are represented, when does inlining happen (or
not happen). `__attribute__((noinline, noipa))` and
`#ppragma GCC optimize` are a great help here.

Once an example is isolated to a single file it's usually
straightforward to shrink it down to something so tiny that it's obvious
where `gcc` (or original program!) went wrong and turned the program into
the bug. `-fdump*` set of options are a great help at exploring step by
step program transformation in `gcc`. I rarely need to add debugging to
`gcc` source to understand where roughly things went wrong.

Individual `gcc` passes have good source comments and nice internal
state dumps to inspect the process and to spot deficiencies like missing
optimizations or bugs.

`ipa-cp` is a conceptually simple pass that is easy to reason about and
debug.

All in all it took me about 2 weeks of evenings to reduce the example
from `llvm` to a single-file example and 3 days to derive a
proof-of-concept fix. After that it took `gcc` developers less than a
day to write and validate the proper fix.

The fix was almost a one-liner. Now on to the `ffmpeg`
[miscompilation](https://gcc.gnu.org/PR107879) :)

Have fun!
