title: "How do shared library collisions break?"
date: June 18, 2022

## background

Shared libraries are fun. The concept is simple in theory: we move a
piece of code out of the main application into a separate (dynamically
loadable) binary and nothing changes:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-1.svg)

In practice we get two moving parts where each could be updated
separately. People still don't agree if shared libraries are a net win
or a net loss as a concept :)

When you maintain both application and library as a single code base the
difference does not really matter. Things get interesting when library
starts it's own life as a separate project and gets it's own dependencies
over time.

What if we want to use two different versions of the same library project
within a single application. Say, use `gtk-2` and `gtk-3` together or
`ffmpeg-4` and `ffmpeg-5`.

You might even do it by accident by including two dependencies that rely
on different `ffmpeg` versions:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-2.svg)

Is it a safe combination? Can we just link against both versions of a
library and be done with it? Let's try!

## a toy example

We'll need an executable and two libraries to play with. Library API
provides a single function to tell us it's name:

```c
// $ cat lib.h
const char * lib_name (void);
```

Library sources implement the API by returning pointer to source file name:

```c
// $ cat lib1.c
#include "lib.h"

const char * lib_name (void) {  return __FILE__; }
```

```c
// $ cat lib2.c
#include "lib.h"

const char * lib_name (void) {  return __FILE__; }
```

Main program:

```c
// $ cat main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <unistd.h>

#include "lib.h"

int main() {
    /* important part: */
    fprintf (stderr, "lib_name() = %s\n", lib_name());

    /* library loading introspection: */
    fprintf (stderr, "My address space:\n");
    char cmd[1000];
    /* search for code segments (should be at most one per loaded ELF) */
    snprintf(cmd, sizeof (cmd), "grep 'r-x' /proc/%u/maps", getpid());
    system(cmd);
}
```

The important bit here is `fprintf (stderr, "lib_name() = %s\n", lib_name());`.
The rest is convenience debugging to see what libraries are loaded
into address space.

What happens if we link `main.c` dynamically against both `lib1.c` and
`lib2.c` together as external shared libraries?

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-3.svg)

Would linker complain? Would it pick first library? Or maybe the second one? It depends!

Let's build shared libraries the simplest way possible and link
our program against them:

```
$ mkdir -p l1 l2

# no SONAME

$ gcc -fPIC -shared lib1.c -o l1/libl1.so
$ gcc -fPIC -shared lib2.c -o l2/libl2.so

$ gcc main.c -o main1 -Ll1 -Ll2 -ll1 -ll2 -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/l1' -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/l2'
$ gcc main.c -o main2 -Ll1 -Ll2 -ll2 -ll1 -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/l1' -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/l2'
```

Quiz question: what would these `./main1` and
`./main2` programs print when executed?

Now let's compare the results:

```
$ ./main1 | unnix
lib_name() = lib1.c
My address space:
00401000-00402000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1404344872                         /home/slyfox/dev/c/shared-libs/main1

7fff98b52000-7fff98b54000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                          [vdso]

$ ./main2 | unnix
lib_name() = lib2.c
My address space:
00401000-00402000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1404344873                         /home/slyfox/dev/c/shared-libs/main2
7f95c8773000-7f95c88dd000 r-xp 00028000 00:1b 1350927183                 /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libc.so.6
7f95c894a000-7f95c894b000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1404344870                 /home/slyfox/dev/c/shared-libs/l1/libl1.so
7f95c894f000-7f95c8950000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1404344871                 /home/slyfox/dev/c/shared-libs/l2/libl2.so
7f95c8956000-7f95c897b000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1350927176                 /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7ffdbb255000-7ffdbb257000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                          [vdso]
```

Note: `lib_name()` returns two very different results. And that is for
a program that is linked against the same set of libraries and headers
in both cases!

A few more observations:

- `ld` did not complain about `lib_name()` presence in both
  `libl1.so` and `libl2.so`.
- Both libraries are loaded into address space (visible in address space
  dumps).
- `./main{1,2}` also did not complain about `lib_name()` presence in
  both `libl1.so` and `libl2.so`.
- Libraries happen to be loaded in order specified by **-l** options.

Now let's pretend that `libl1.so` and `libl2.so` don't have material
difference and implement identical ABI and semantics. On `ELF` platforms
`ABI` and semantics are usually reflected by a `DT_SONAME` tag attached
to a library. We can assign `SONAME` to built library with
`-Wl,-soname,...` flag. Let's specify identical `SONAME` to both
libraries (I also had to create symlinks to `SONAME` name):

```
$ mkdir -p l1 l2

# same SONAME

$ gcc -fPIC -shared lib1.c -o l1/libl1.so -Wl,-soname,libname.so.1
$ ln -s libl1.so l1/libname.so.1
$ gcc -fPIC -shared lib2.c -o l2/libl2.so -Wl,-soname,libname.so.1
$ ln -s libl2.so l2/libname.so.1

$ gcc main.c -o main1 -Ll1 -Ll2 -ll1 -ll2 -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/l1' -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/l2'
$ gcc main.c -o main2 -Ll1 -Ll2 -ll1 -ll2 -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/l2' -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/l1'
```

Quiz question: how would these result differ compared to previous run?

Comparing the results again:

```
$ ./main1 | unnix
lib_name() = lib1.c
My address space:
00401000-00402000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1404345186                         /home/slyfox/dev/c/shared-libs/main1

$ ./main2 | unnix
lib_name() = lib2.c
My address space:
00401000-00402000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1404345187                         /home/slyfox/dev/c/shared-libs/main2
7f2c1a48d000-7f2c1a5f7000 r-xp 00028000 00:1b 1350927183                 /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libc.so.6
7f2c1a664000-7f2c1a665000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1404345185                 /home/slyfox/dev/c/shared-libs/l2/libl2.so
7f2c1a66b000-7f2c1a690000 r-xp 00001000 00:1b 1350927176                 /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
7ffd7c1ba000-7ffd7c1bc000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                          [vdso]
```

Note:

- Only one example of a library with a specified `SONAME` is loaded into
  memory: either `libl1.so` or `libl2.so`, but never both.
- First library is loaded as specified by `DT_RUNPATH` tag (not by
  `-l` option).

Library order matters materially only if a symbol is present
in multiple shared libraries (a symbol collision is present). Otherwise
you don't have to worry about it.

Another important assumption here is that `lib.h` is identical for both
`libl1.so` and `libl2.so`. It's not always the case for more complex
scenarios: `ffmpeg` and `gtk` certainly change their API and data
structures across major releases (or even in different build configurations
for the same library release).

## diamond dependency trees

Is it a frequent problem to get a mix of libraries like that in a single
process? Or it's a purely hypothetical problem not worth worrying about?
Let's pick `gdb` executable (command line debugger) as an example.

Quiz question: how many libraries does `gdb` use as dependencies. Should
it be just `libc`? Maybe `ncurses` as well?

`ELF` files have `DT_NEEDED` entries in `.dynamic` section. Those
list all immediate shared library dependencies. We can dump
`DT_NEEDED` entries with tools like `objdump`, `readelf`, `scanelf`,
`patchelf` and many others. I'll use `patchelf`:

```
$ patchelf --print-needed `which gdb` | nl
     1  libreadline.so.8
     2  libz.so.1
     3  libncursesw.so.6
     4  libpython3.9.so.1.0
     5  libdl.so.2
     6  libcrypt.so.1
     7  libm.so.6
     8  libexpat.so.1
     9  libipt.so.2
    10  libmpfr.so.6
    11  libgmp.so.10
    12  libsource-highlight.so.4
    13  libboost_regex.so.1.77.0
    14  libstdc++.so.6
    15  libgcc_s.so.1
    16  libpthread.so.0
    17  libc.so.6
    18  ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```

18 immediate libraries! Some of them have their own dependencies.
We can dump the whole tree with `lddtree`:

```
$ lddtree `which gdb` | unnix | nl
lddtree `which gdb` | unnix | nl
     1  gdb => /run/current-system/sw/bin/gdb (interpreter => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2)

    15          librt.so.1 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/librt.so.1
    16          libicudata.so.71 => /<<NIX>>/icu4c-71.1/lib/libicudata.so.71
    17          libicui18n.so.71 => /<<NIX>>/icu4c-71.1/lib/libicui18n.so.71
    18          libicuuc.so.71 => /<<NIX>>/icu4c-71.1/lib/libicuuc.so.71
    19      libstdc++.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/gcc-11.3.0-lib/lib/libstdc++.so.6
    20      libgcc_s.so.1 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libgcc_s.so.1
    21      libpthread.so.0 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libpthread.so.0
    22      libc.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libc.so.6
    23      ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```

Just 4 more libraries added by `boost` internals: `libboost_regex.so.1.77.0` -> `librt.so.1`,
`libicudata.so.71`, `libicui18n.so.71`, `libicuuc.so.71`.

From `lddtree` output it might look like it's a rare occasion when shared libraries
have their own dependencies. That is misleading: `lddtree` hides already printed
entries by default.

Quiz question: guess how many dependencies does `gdb` have if we consider all the
duplicates.

We'll use `lddtree -a` option to answer that question:

```
$ lddtree -a `which gdb` | unnix | nl
     1  gdb => /run/current-system/sw/bin/gdb (interpreter => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2)
     2      libreadline.so.8 => /<<NIX>>/readline-8.1p2/lib/libreadline.so.8
     3          libncursesw.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/ncurses-6.3-p20220507/lib/libncursesw.so.6
     4              libc.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libc.so.6
     5                  ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
     6          libc.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libc.so.6
     7              ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

     9          libc.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libc.so.6
    10              ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
    11      libncursesw.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/ncurses-6.3-p20220507/lib/libncursesw.so.6
    12          libc.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libc.so.6
    13              ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
    14      libpython3.9.so.1.0 => /<<NIX>>/python3-3.9.13/lib/libpython3.9.so.1.0
    15          libdl.so.2 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libdl.so.2
    16              libc.so.6 => not found
    17          libcrypt.so.1 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libcrypt.so.1
    18              libc.so.6 => not found
...
   263      libc.so.6 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/libc.so.6
   264          ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
   265      ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /<<NIX>>/glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```

265! It's more than 10x compared to the output without duplicates. A thing
to note here is that `libc.so.6` is a frequent guest here. The 265 number
is also inflated as many subtrees repeat multiple times here.

If we use something more heavyweight like `i3` window manager we'll
get even bigger dependency tree:

```
$ lddtree `which i3` | wc -l
61
$ lddtree -a `which i3` | wc -l
1528
```

Let's draw `gdb` dependencies as a graph. I find the result less scary:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-4.svg)

OK, it's still unreadable.

Let's remove all the `glibc` and `gcc` dependencies. They are
present almost everywhere and clutter our graph. Here is the result
of graph with noise removed:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-5.svg)

Now it should be more obvious what `gdb` usually uses.

`Diamond dependencies` are the ones that have more than one input arrow:
they cause dependency graph to be a `graph` instead of a `tree`.

Another way to look at it applied to library dependencies: `diamond
dependencies have more than one path in the graph from dependency
root`.

For example `libncursesw.so.6` can be reached via two distinct paths:

- `gdb` -> `libncursesw.so.6` (direct dependency)
- `gdb` -> `libreadline.so.8` -> `libncursesw.so.6` (indirect dependency)

From the toy example above we know that the same library does not
get loaded multiple times if the absolute library path is the same.

Problems happen when such a diamond dependency is slightly different
in two branches. There are many ways to break this diamond by accident.
The most popular one is to have slightly different `SONAMEs` in two
branches:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-6.svg)

To make it work at all `libfoo.so.1` and `libfoo.so.2` need to
have no colliding symbols or make this mix and match work via other
means. Most `C` libraries don't handle such coexistence. They assume
that everyone can update to `libfoo.so.2` and `libfoo.so.1` would
never compete with it:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-7.svg)

## Example failures

Unfortunately nothing prevents such inconsistent diamonds with a
library version mix to appear. We just did it ourselves in our toy
example. How come do we not get into that state all the time? Or
maybe we do?

Normally distributions try hard to avoid such version mix by not
providing two versions of a library at any point in time: there
are no two `glibc` version installed, no two `ffmpeg` versions
present and so on.

But to each rule there is an exception: not all applications have
migrated from `python2` to `python3`, some applications are
still on `gtk-2`, most on `gtk-3` and some are already on
`gtk-4`. In these cases you might find all these libraries in
your system. Their presence might create false confidence that it's
a safe setup. It is not.

Here are a few examples I saw the past:

## `gdb` and `tinfo`/`tinfow`

This example is based on <https://bugs.gentoo.org/669096> where `gdb`
crashed at start. `ncurses` provides a few flavors of roughly the
same library with slightly different APIs: `ncurses` (no unicode
support) and `ncursesw` (has unicode support). Sometimes distributions
also enable split-library version of `ncurses`: `ncursesw.so`+`tinfow.so`
and `ncurses.so`+`tinfo.so`.

In 2022 you would normally use `ncursesw` library everywhere (or
`ncursesw.so`+`tinfow.so` everywhere in distributions with split
setup).

Due to a minor `configure.ac` glitch `gdb` managed to pull in the
following library dependency graph:

```
  $ lddtree /usr/bin/gdb
  /usr/bin/gdb (interpreter => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2)
    libtinfo.so.6 => /lib64/libtinfo.so.6
    libreadline.so.7 => /lib64/libreadline.so.7
        libncurses.so.6 => /lib64/libncurses.so.6
    libncursesw.so.6 => /lib64/libncursesw.so.6
        libtinfow.so.6 => /lib64/libtinfow.so.6
    ...
```

See the problem already? Picture form might help a bit:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-8.svg)

I see two problems:

- unicode and non-unicode flavors are both present: `ncurses.so` + `ncursesw.so`
- unicode and non-unicode parts: `ncursesw.so` + `tinfo.so` (or `ncursesw.so` + `tinfow.so`)

`libncursesw.so.6` and `libncurses.so.6` export
the same symbol names. That on it's own might work. But ABI assumptions
around private data structures in `w` and non-`w` libraries are
different. For example `WINDOWLIST` structure has different size and
has extra fields:

```c
    // Somewhere in ncurses/curses.priv.h
    // ...
    struct _win_list {
        struct _win_list *next;
        SCREEN *screen;
        WINDOW win;
    #if NCURSES_WIDECHAR
        char addch_work[(MB_LEN_MAX * 9) + 1];
        unsigned addch_used;
        int addch_x;
        int addch_y;
    #endif
};
```

If such a structure would be allocated in `libncurses.so` (without
`NCURSES_WIDECHAR`) and be used as `libncursesw.so` there will
likely be data corruption in an attempt to write to non-existent tail
of structure (fields `addch_work`, `addch_used`, `addch_x`,
`addch_y` don't get allocated in `libncurses.so`).

The fix was to update `gdb` to always link to `tinfow` if
`ncursesw` is present. And to fix `readline` to link to `ncursesw`
to match the default of the rest of distribution.

Case of `readline` is especially worrying: if `libreadline.so.7` ->
`libncurses.so.6` was a conscious decision by `readline` packagers
then `gdb`
would have to inspect it's dependency first to match it's defaults when
picking the `ncurses` flavor at `gdb` build time. Nobody analyzes
transitive dependencies in `C` land and assumes that build environment
provides consistent and unambiguous
environment: there should be just one library of `ncurses` discoverable
via `pkgconfig` (or similar) and that version should be used when building
both `readline` and `gdb`.

I would say that providing both `libncurses.so` and `libncursesw.so`
in the same system is proven to be dangerous. Perhaps providing just
`SONAMEs` like `libncurses.so.6` would be slightly less prone to
accidental linkage of unintended library.

## `binutils` and `multitarget`

Another example from Gentoo's `bugzilla`: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/666100>.

It starts off very similar to `ncurses`: Gentoo provides a way to
install multiple versions of `libbfd.so` library:

- via `sys-devel/binutils` package, install target is `/usr/lib64/binutils/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/2.38/libbfd-2.38.so`
- via `sys-libs/binutils-libs` package, install target is `/usr/lib64/libbfd-2.38.so`

Gentoo allows multiple parallel major versions of `sys-devel/binutils`
to be present in the system at the same time. And allows only one version of
`sys-libs/binutils-libs`. The split
is needed for limitations of package manager library handling. The idea
is that `sys-devel/binutils` libraries will ever be used only by
`sys-devel/binutils` itself: `strip`, `ld` and friends will use
private library. While external users (like `perf` or `ghc`) will
never use it and will always pull in `sys-libs/binutils-libs` library:

- `strip-2.38` -> `/usr/lib64/binutils/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/2.38/libbfd-2.38.so` (`SONAME=libbfd-2.38.so`)
- `ld-2.38` -> `/usr/lib64/binutils/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/2.38/libbfd-2.38.so` (`SONAME=libbfd-2.38.so`)
- `ld-2.37` -> `/usr/lib64/binutils/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/2.37/libbfd-2.37.so` (`SONAME=libbfd-2.37.so`)
- `perf` -> `/usr/lib64/libbfd-2.38.so` (`SONAME=libbfd-2.38.so`)

Or the same in pictures:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-9.svg)

The sets are seemingly disjoint. It should be fine, right? Wrong.

The problem happens when some build system decides to use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib`
override (like `firefox` [one](https://bugs.gentoo.org/645222)). It
looks cosmetic as `/usr/lib` is already a default library search path. It should not
hurt. But in practice it redirects `libbfd-2.38.so` from:

- `ld-2.38` -> `/usr/lib64/binutils/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/2.38/libbfd-2.38.so`

to:

- `ld-2.38` -> `/usr/lib64/libbfd-2.38.so`

After the redirect effective runtime dependency graph looks as:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-10.svg)

Is it a big deal? Shouldn't these libraries already be identical?
They share `SONAME=libbfd-2.38.so` after all.

Unfortunately, no: `binutils` can be built in a few different incompatible
modes that affect library `ABI` compatibility:

1. default mode: support only current target and use default file offsets
   (32-bit offsets on 32-bit systems, 64-bit offsets on 64-bit systems).
2. 64-bit mode (`--enable-64-bit-bfd`): support only current target
   and use 64-bit file offsets
3. multi-target mode (`--enable-targets=all`): support multiple target
   architectures and use 64-bit file offsets.

All these 3 modes produce the same `SONAME=libbfd-2.38.so`, but
it's ABIs differ quite a bit: 64-bit mode switches public API from
`typedef unsigned long bfd_vma;` to `typedef uint64_t bfd_size_type`.
This breaks global `_bfd_std_section`  array size and breaks ABI similar
to [`nettle` ABI breakage](/posts/195-dynamic-linking-ABI-is-hard.html).

As a result attempt to force `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib` on 32-bit systems
fails as:

```
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib ld --eh-frame-hdr -m elf_i386 -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2 -o z /usr/lib/Scrt1.o
ld: internal error /dev/shm/portage/sys-devel/binutils-2.38/work/binutils-2.38/ld/ldlang.c 6635
```

The fix (or workaround) was straightforward: change `SONAME=libbfd-2.38.so`
to something that depends on the configuration: `SONAME=libbfd-2.38-64-bit.so`
or similar:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-11.svg)

Mike also suggested another fix: use `DT_RPATH` `ELF` tags in `binutils`
binaries instead of `DT_RUNPATH` to get higher precedence over `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath>.

I think this bug is a good example why you should try hard to avoid multiple
libraries in the system with the same `SONAME`: seemingly uncontroversial
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` can cause so much trouble.

## `mpfr`/`mpc` version mismatch

Another case is <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Mpfr4-update-guide>.

In a steady state `gcc` and it's `mpc` dependency both depend on `mpfr`.
All three are distinct packages in `Gentoo` and can only be updated one at a time
on a live system.

Once `mpfr` is updated it brings into the system a new library: `libmpfr.so.4`.
On it's own it's fine as `gcc` and `mpc` still refer to `libmpfr.so.3` (which
does not get deleted as long as there are referrers to it).

The problem happens when we try to update `mpc`: we introduce a
broken diamond dependency as two versions of `mpfr` get pulled into `gcc`:

![](/posts.data/248-shlib-clash/fig-12.svg)

By luck it did not render `gcc` broken as `gcc` was able to recompile itself.
Otherwise user would have to redownload broken compiler. Or an ad-hoc upgrade
tool would have to be written just for this case.

I wonder how other distributions solve this class of lockstep upgrade problems
in their build systems.

## does `nix` magically solve diamond dependency problem?

The short answer is: no, it does not fundamentally prevent such
relations from happening. It is even more prone to accidentally
inconsistent diamonds as it allows you to install multiple versions
of the same library in parallel (say, `glibc` or `ncurses`)
and be pulled in both as a dependency.

The typical example would be an incorrect attempt to enable debugging
mode for some popular dependency. Say, `ncurses` for `gdb`:

```
# DO NOT USE IT AS IS
$ nix build --impure --expr 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; gdb.override { ncurses = ncurses.overrideAttrs(oa: { NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = "-O0"; }); }'
```

Looks benign, isn't it? We pass slightly modified unoptimised
`ncurses` dependency to `gdb`.

Unfortunately `gdb`'s `readline` dependency also uses `ncurses`.
And in this case it uses unmodified version of `ncurses`. We
can see it in the resulting binary:

```
lddtree -a ./result/bin/gdb |& fgrep -B1 ncurses
    libreadline.so.8 => /nix/store/87g044p2zq221fvjzyrqyrkzxxayy1p9-readline-8.1p2/lib/libreadline.so.8
        libncursesw.so.6 => /nix/store/7ji068smnymqz2lg2fd42hjnjd5czbl6-ncurses-6.3-p20220507/lib/libncursesw.so.6
--
            ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /nix/store/fz33c1mfi2krpg1lwzizfw28kj705yg0-glibc-2.34-210/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
    libncursesw.so.6 => /nix/store/3hwz3archcn9z8y93b2qdnkrgdf7g5jb-ncurses-6.3-p20220507/lib/libncursesw.so.6
```

To be fair this output is slightly misleading as both
`libncursesw.so.6` should be loaded by `DT_RUNPTH` and would probably
end up being pulled in from the same location. There would be no
double-load. But it's hard to predict which of the two would win.

To sidestep this kind of problems `nixpkgs` tries hard to use a
single version of a library throughout the tree. As a result the
whole system you build will use the same `ncurses` library.
And it does not have to be the same `ncurses` you used for
older version of your system.

The less incorrect way to achieve the `-O0` effect for `ncurses`
would be to override the `ncurses` attribute itself and let
all the packages (up to `gdb`) use it. One way to do it
is via <https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays>:

```
# slightly better
$ nix build --impure --expr 'with import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [(final: prev: { ncurses = prev.ncurses.overrideAttrs(oa: { NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = "-O0"; }); })]; }; gdb'
[2/0/33 built, 5 copied (0.8/0.8 MiB), 0.2 MiB DL] building readline-8.1p2 (buildPhase): mv search.o search.so
...
```

Note: this command attempts to rebuild 33 packages:

```
$ nix build --impure --expr 'with import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [(final: prev: { ncurses = prev.ncurses.overrideAttrs(oa: { NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = " -O0"; }); })]; }; gdb' --dry-run |& unnix
these 34 derivations will be built:
  /<<NIX>>/ncurses-6.3-p20220507.drv
  /<<NIX>>/readline-6.3p08.drv
  /<<NIX>>/python3-3.9.13.drv

Now we can verify that all `libncursesw.so.6` instances are pulled in from a single path:

```
$ lddtree -a ./result/bin/gdb |& fgrep -B1 ncurses
    libreadline.so.8 => /nix/store/k8p8sj27cgblad8f0zavpzwwyvv5gn0d-readline-8.1p2/lib/libreadline.so.8
        libncursesw.so.6 => /nix/store/3hwz3archcn9z8y93b2qdnkrgdf7g5jb-ncurses-6.3-p20220507/lib/libncursesw.so.6

    libncursesw.so.6 => /nix/store/3hwz3archcn9z8y93b2qdnkrgdf7g5jb-ncurses-6.3-p20220507/lib/libncursesw.so.6
```

## allowed symbol collisions

There are a few cases when it is natural to have symbol collisions:

- when final executable wants to override function implementation from a library it can
  define the function with the same prototype. I'll carefully ignore details of `hidden`
  visibility symbols here.

- when executable or library wants to provide a fallback function in case it's not
  present anywhere else it can use weak symbol: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_symbol>

If you use neither of the above you still can load libraries with
clashing symbols. You would have to use `dlopen("path/to/lib.so", RTLD_LOCAL)`
/ `dlsym()` to extract symbols under non-ambiguous names. Plugins frequently
use this technique to avoid namespace pollution and to simplify plugin unloading.

Typical examples of `LD_PRELOAD` users that rely on runtime symbol overload are:

- `jemalloc`: <https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/wiki/Getting-Started> (overrides `malloc()` and friends)
- `tcmalloc`: <https://gperftools.github.io/gperftools/tcmalloc.html> (overrides `malloc()` and friends)
- `tsocks`: <https://linux.die.net/man/8/tsocks> (overrides `socket()` and friends)
- `fakeroot`: <https://linux.die.net/man/1/fakeroot-tcp> (overrides file APIs)
- `sandbox`: <https://github.com/gentoo/sandbox/blob/master/README.md> (overrides file APIs)
- `libeatmydata`: <https://www.flamingspork.com/projects/libeatmydata/> (overrides `fsync()` API)

## parting words

Symbol clashes are nasty. They are most frequent to appear when multiple
versions of the same library are loaded into the program over different
dependency paths.

Default toolchain support does not help much in catching duplicate symbols.
You might have to resort to local hacks to detect such cases. Or you can add
a feature to your favorite linker!

Luckily there is a simple rule to follow to avoid it most if the time:
try hard not to expose more than one version of a library in your dependency
graph.

Have fun!
