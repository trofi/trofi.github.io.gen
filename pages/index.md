Welcome, internet wanderer! My general area of interest is CPU
architectures and toolchains supporting them. I know a little bit about
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux),
[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and
[Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell)

I occasionally [blog](/blog.html) about the things I encounter. Mostly for general
amusement.

For shorter and more volatile updates you might want to check
out [@trofi@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@trofi).

Enjoy!
