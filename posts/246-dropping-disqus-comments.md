title: "dropping disqus comments"
date: June 01, 2022

This personal blog gets roughly one comment a month. For some reason
`disqus` decided to add automatically generated advertisement section
around comments.
I think `disqus` decided that this page does not qualify as a personal
blog anymore.
I dropped the integration. Now each post has a footer with an
[email](mailto:slyich@gmail.com) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/trofi/trofi.github.io.gen)
reference.

I do understand that it's very inconvenient in case you want to reach
out. My apologies.
