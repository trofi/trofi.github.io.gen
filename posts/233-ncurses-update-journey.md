title: "ncurses update journey"
date: January 03, 2022
---

A few months ago I decided to upgrade a few packages in `nixpkgs` to
the latest available versions upstream. Some packages like `gzip`,
`grep`, `texinfo`, `linuxHeaders` or `terminus_font` were
straightforward to handle. Most of them required 1-2 (or none) reverse
dependencies to fix. Sometimes upstream already had available fixes to
pull.

## `ncurses` breakage

But one surprising package was `ncurses`: upstream had `6.3` version
released for a while but `nixpkgs` had `6.2`. Should be trivial to
update I thought. Probably just a bunch of new terminals added into
`terminfo`.
I updated `ncurses` locally and instantly got a few build failures.
Most of those looked similar to the following `mtr` failure:

``` 
ui/curses.c:765:42:
  error: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security]
  765 |         mvprintw(rowstat - 1, startstat, msg);
      |                                          ^~~
```

The build error popped up because new release of `ncurses` enabled
`printf`-like annotations to a few its frequently used functions:

```

This change enables `GCC_PRINTF` by default and adds extra annotations
to `vwprintw` and friends. I think `mtr` was broken by
`GCC_PRINTF` default change.
The package fixes are usually trivial. `mtr` one looks like

## Does error flag a real problem?

Is this kind of build errors a big deal or just a nuisance? All these
programs probably work just fine if nobody noticed the infelicity.
Let's craft a small example:

``` c
// $cat a.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

#if defined(GCC_PRINTF)
#    define GCC_PRINTFLIKE(fmt,var) __attribute__((format(printf,fmt,var)))
#else
#    define GCC_PRINTFLIKE(fmt,var) /* nope */
#endif

int just_like_printf(const char * fmt, ...) GCC_PRINTFLIKE(1,2);
int just_like_printf(const char * fmt, ...)
{
    va_list ap;
    va_start(ap, fmt);
    va_end(ap);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    just_like_printf(argv[0]);
}
```

``` 
$ gcc a.c -o a -Wall
$ ./a
./a
```

Here we just print program's name as is via `printf(argv[0])`. Does
not look too bad, right?
No. Uncontrolled format strings allow for arbitrary memory access.
We can read register and stack values (needs a tiny bit of platform
`ABI` knowledge):

``` 
$ ln -s a '%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx'
$ ./%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx%#lx
./0x7ffcc15c01c80x7ffcc15c01d80x7fe1dbea759800x7fe1dbea97e00x7ffcc15c01c80x1000000000x401200
```

And if we are creative we can also write chosen data at addresses in
registers or stack:

``` 
$ ln -s a '%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n'
$ ./%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

`suid` CLI tools are especially vulnerable as command line arguments
and environment also reside on stack. We can store "any" address there
just by running the tool with extra environment variables.
`sudo` had a similar vulnerability in the past that allows arbitrary
code execution:
<https://www.vnsecurity.net/research/2012/02/16/exploiting-sudo-format-string-vunerability.html>
Mounting a shell exploit on modern systems is an exercise for the reader
:)

Thus yes, passing uncontrolled text to `printf()`-like function is a
direct path to arbitrary code execution. In case of networking services
it's an `RCE`. In case of CLI tools that interpret external input (say,
`mp3` players or network packet visualisers) it can easily become
user-assisted `RCE`.

## `-Wformat=`

This kind of bugs used to be a very common programming error until
compilers learned to catch it when asked:

``` 
$ gcc a.c -o a -Wall -DGCC_PRINTF -Wformat=2
a.c: In function 'main':
a.c:25:5: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]
   25 |     just_like_printf(argv[0]);
      |     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Note that by default it's just a warning that you need to opt into with
`-Wformat=2`. Many distributions enable `*-Wformat=2` by default
either in toolchain directly or in package build process.
For quite a while `nixpkgs` enables `-Werror=format-security` by
default which turns warnings on suspicious code into errors:

``` 
$ gcc a.c -o a -Wall -DGCC_PRINTF -Werror=format-security
a.c: In function 'main':
a.c:25:5: error: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security]
   25 |     just_like_printf(argv[0]);
      |     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cc1: some warnings being treated as errors
```

Package maintainers usually weed out all these problems when they add a
new package version to the distribution.
But case of `ncurses` is a bit special: it's a very popular decades
old library with many users. For decades there were plenty chances of
using it's interfaces in an unsafe manner.

## Fixing all the failures

Given that `mtr` had this deficiency how many more tools would be
broken like that? I hoped for "under 10" and started fixing packages
one by one.

After fixing 40 packages (`mtr`, `libcdio`, `aewan`,
`tty-solitaire`, `bastet`, `mcabber`, `bwm_ng`, `toxic`,
`nudoku`, `ecasound`, `bemenu`, `tasknc`, `smemstat`,
`freesweep`, `gfs2-utils`, `gmu`, `hexcurse`, `irqbalance`,
`hstr`, `pinfo`, `lifelines`, `tty-clock`, `nethogs`,
`host`, `jnettop`, `mp3blaster`, `multitail`, `musikcube`,
`ncdc`, `pacvim`, `powertop`, `profanity`, `sngrep`,
`tiptop`, `trafficserver`, `vimpc`, `wiimms-iso-tools`,
`souffle`) I realized I would not be able to find (or fix) all the
breakages myself and would need help.
Having asked around I found out I could get a `hydra` build run
against a <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/146685> pull request. I
requested a run on `#infra:nixos.org` matrix room.
Vladimir suggested rebasing the pull request against `master` commit
with already
present `hydra` run. That way `hydra` UI would allow for easy
regression comparison via "compare-to" drop down. First run (targeted
`x86_64-linux` only) took `~5` days: 1 to 6 Dec. It was a full rebuild
of all packages as `ncurses` is a `bash` dependency via
`readline`. 5 days felt as very quick given that this run had low
priority against other preempting jobs: builds of `master` itself and
builds of `staging-next`.
The initial run looked promising:
<https://hydra.nixos.org/eval/1727143?compare=1727080&full=0>.
It reported "Newly Failing Jobs (94)". Some of these were unrelated
flaky failures but `~10` of them were more `ncurses` fall out that I
missed from local runs: `postgresqlPackages.pg_auto_failover`,
`rogue`, `wyrd`, `squishyball`, `haskellPackages.ncurses`,
`liboping`, `linuxPackages.sysdig`, `tcptrack`, `pamix`,
`tlf`. Fixing them was straightforward.
While hydra was running through packages I fixed `~10` more:
`_2048-in-terminal`, `liboping`, `noice`, `samtools`,
`libviper`, `vwm`, `gptfdisk`, `spdk`, `nfstrace`.
I hope to get `ncurses-6.3` merged within first days of 2022 \\o/

## Does it scale?

Fixing 60 packages took 2 months. Usually it takes sending a fix
upstream, proposing a pull request to `nixpkgs` and following up both
down to acceptance :)
That gives us one fix per day on average.
I have a vague plan of trying to get `gcc-10` updated to `gcc-11`.
That has order of magnitude more failures lurking. `gcc-12` has even
more surprises pending. I won't be able to fix or even report all the
failures and will need more scalable plan.

## Tl;DR

- `__attribute__((format(...)))` with `-Wformat=...` is still
  a good way to catch trivial format string vulnerabilities.
- While disruptive it's still useful to add format attributes to
  `printf()`-like library APIs.
- There were `~60` packages to fix after `ncurses` update.
- It takes about 5 days to build all of `x86_64-linux` `nixpkgs` on
  `hydra`.

Have fun!
