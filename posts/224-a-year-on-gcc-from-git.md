title: "A year on gcc from git"
date: March 07, 2021
---

Almost [a year](/posts/213-gcc-10-in-gentoo.html) passed since
`gcc-10` arrival in `gentoo`. This means `gcc-11` will release very
soon!
Around that time I decided to switch my main workstation to `gcc` based on
`git master` branch to see how long it would survive before it destroys
something due to a grave compiler bug. Nothing like that happened yet :)
Having volatile compiler version has all sorts of nasty consequences:
you could have a library or a binary miscompiled due to some transient
compiler issue that was fixed a day after it was introduced.
My solution to stale binaries is to rebuild all packages periodically.
To ease the load on the system I have a cron job that rebuilds all the
packages older than a month on my system. It has an effect of upgrading
compiler itself once a month and rebuilds about 3% of all packages
daily.

In this post I'll share a few issues that came up for such a bleeding
edge system. It's not quite a full list, but it touches majority of
encountered bugs.

## SHF_GNU_RETAIN breaks kernel boot

New `SHF_GNU_RETAIN` section flag managed to break kernel boot:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/PR99113> (originally reported as
<https://sourceware.org/PR27412>).

The problem: `gcc-11` changed semantics of existing
`__attribute__((__used__))` code (kernel happens to use it a
lot):

``` c
struct s {
  void *print_fmt;
};
struct s print_fmt_napi_poll[1];
__attribute__((__used__)) struct s event_napi_poll = {print_fmt_napi_poll};
```

- Before `gcc-11`: variable was placed into `.data` section
- In `gcc-11`: variable was placed into `.data.event_napi_poll`

Normally such a section name change is not a problem for user space
programs as `binutils` linker script can handle both names. But `linux`
kernel has custom linker scripts that did not account for new names.

The fix: `gcc-11` reverted semantic change and now enables it only
with new `__attribute__((__retain__))` attribute:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=6347f4a0904fce17eedf5c071be6f3c118680290>

The bug effect: kernel did not boot, kernel build log was full of
unknown section warnings.

## `-fipa-modref` breaks `glibc` `printf`

New `-fipa-modref` `gcc` optimization managed to break `glibc`:
<https://sourceware.org/PR26690> (originally reported as
<https://gcc.gnu.org/PR97264>).

The problem: `glibc` had an interesting aliasing violation bug in
`vfprintf` family of functions. In it's simpler form bug looked like
that:

``` c
void vfprintf_internal(const char * format_string, ...) {
    const char * p = format_string;
    ...
    // [1]: somewhere in another helper function:
    ++(const unsinged char **)&p;
    ...
    // continue using 'p':
}
```

- Before `gcc-11`: variable `p` was advanced with `[1]`
- In `gcc-11`: variable `p` did not change with `[1]` as `gcc`
  assumed `char` and `unsinged char` (and their pointers) are two
  different types that don't alias and thus operations on them are
  independent.

The fix: the aliasing was fixed in `glibc` with
<https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=c0e9ddf59e73e21afe15fca4e94cf7b4b7359bf2>

The bug effect: `uname -p` did hang up and caused `gcc-11` `gentoo`
users some inconvenience: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/750992>.
This bug is very scary: it specifically breaks digit parsing in format
strings like `"%10s"` and has the potential of causing silent data
corruption.

## `-fipa-modref` breaks return value optimization

New `-fipa-modref` `gcc` optimization managed to break `libsass`
library tests and exposed a compiler flaw: <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98499>

The sample example is:

``` c++
struct string {
  char * _M_buf;
  // local store
  char _M_local_buf[16];

  string() : _M_buf(_M_local_buf) {}

  ~string() {
    if (_M_buf != _M_local_buf)
      __builtin_trap();
  }
};

static string dir_name() { return string(); }

int main() {
   ...
   string s = dir_name(); 
   ...
}
```

Before `gcc-11`:

``` 
$ g++-10.2.0 -O2 main.cc -o a && ./a
<ok>
```

In `gcc-11`:

``` 
$ g++-11.0.0 -O2 main.cc -o a && ./a
Illegal instruction     (core dumped) ./a
```

`gcc-11` managed to optimize `if (_M_buf != _M_local_buf)
__builtin_trap();` into `__builtin_trap();` instead of expected
no-op. It happened because `gcc` `moderf` analysis wrongly assumed
that if `s` is a local variable then it's `s._M_buf` is also a
local variable and never escapes.
Unfortunately Return Value Optimization effectively turns local
variables into non-local variables as they escape outside the function
they are defined.

The fix: `gcc` was fixed to make less optimistic escaping rules for
values touched by `RVO`:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=11056ab7687f7156846e93557c9171b77713bd7e>.
Longer term `gcc` will improve on `RVO` tracking:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98925>

The bug effect: [`libsass`](https://github.com/sass/libsass) tests started
failing for [`libsass` `haskell`
bindings](https://github.com/jakubfijalkowski/hlibsass).

It took me quite a while (perhaps a week of winter evenings) to extract
the reasonably sized test case. It was very elusive because bug only
appears in cases when `inliner` did not do a reasonable job due to
various corner cases while `ipa-modref` did (that's why actual test
case is full of `__attribute__((noinline))` annotations.
I also used it as an opportunity to explore and fix my first non-trivial
`gcc` bug :)

## `firefox` deadlock in `LTO`+`PGO`

New change in `-fprofile-generate` around most frequent value tracking
introduced a deadlock scenario in `firefox`:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/PR97461>. `firefox` code is similar to:

``` c
// Override default malloc with it's own allocator
void * malloc(size_t size) {
    // something with TOPN profile, like:
    ...
    return per_bucket_implementation[size % N]();
}

int main() {
    void * p = malloc(8);
    return p != 0;
}
```

Code, generated by `gcc` in `-fprofile-generate` mode converts it
to:

``` c
// inserted by gcc
static counter __gcov3_malloc;

// Override default malloc with it's own allocator
void * malloc(size_t size) {
    // something with TOPN profile, like:
    ...
    // inserted by gcc
    gcov_topn_add_value(__gcov3_malloc, pper_bucket_implementation[size % N]);
    ...
    return per_bucket_implementation[size % N]();
}

int main() {
    void * p = malloc(8);
    return p != 0;
}
```

New implementation of `gcov_topn_add_value` now uses dynamic memory
allocation:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=871e5ada6d53d5eb>
(previously it used static (`GCOV_TOPN_VALUES = 4`).
This started causing infinite recursion: `malloc() ->
gcov_topn_add_value() -> malloc()`.

The fix: `gcc` `gcov` library now uses `mmap()` directly to
track `TOPN` counters and avoids `malloc()`:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=00d79dc4be0b86ec564cfa2b32c47de6c07449e6>

## Array attributes type check

`gcc` failed to compile `emacs-27.1` that uses unusual `VLA`
declaration in function parameters: <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR97413>

``` 
$ cat fns.c
int a(long b, const int a1[b], long c, const int a2[c], int a3[c]);

$ gcc-11.0.0 -c fns.c.c
fns.c.c:1:1: error: wrong number of arguments specified for 'access' attribute
    1 | int a(long b, const int a1[b], long c, const int a2[c], int a3[c]);
      | ^~~
fns.c.c:1:1: note: expected between 1 and 3, found 4
```

The fix: `gcc` now correctly tracks function attributes:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efa5c2a84a8c7c7beb855dec24a321eebcbd6b>

## Webkit miscompilation

`gcc` incorrectly compiled `webkit-gtk-2.28.4` around placement new:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98130>. The following code generates a crashing
program:

``` c++
#include <new>

typedef int *T;

static unsigned char storage[sizeof (T)] alignas (T);
static T *p = (T *) storage;

static inline __attribute__((__always_inline__)) void
foo (T value)
{
  new (p) T(value);
}

int
main ()
{
  int a;
  foo (&a);
  if (!*p)
    __builtin_abort ();
}
```

Here `gcc-11` assumed that `new (p) T(value);` has no side-effect
and removed `*p = value;` part entirely as a dead store as it did not
know if `p` is dereferenced.

The fix: `gcc-11` avoids the optimization for placement operator new:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=78c4a9feceaccf487516aa1eff417e0741556e10>

That was not the only `webkit` miscompilation related to pointer
handling.

## Unhandled template specialization

A few programs based on `gtkmm` library failed to type check:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98115>. In my case it was `pavucontrol`. Small
examle:

``` c
template <class> class Stringify;
template <long N> class Stringify<const char[N]>;
```

``` 
$ g++ layout.ii -c
layout.ii:2:25: error: partial specialization ‘class Stringify<const char [N]>’ is not more specialized than [-fpermissive]
    2 | template <long N> class Stringify<const char[N]>;
      |                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
layout.ii:1:24: note: primary template ‘template<class> class Stringify’
    1 | template <class> class Stringify;
      |                        ^~~~~~~~~
```

`gcc` considered `class` equally unspecialized to `long N`.

The fix: tweak type comparison in `gcc` type checker:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=9d0eb0ae948f0fbee208cfb9a86133abea650f81>

## Overriding target attribute behavior

At some point `gcc` failed `grub` linking with very obscure linker
failure. I'll provide only the source example without linker failure:

``` c
// build as:
//    gcc-11.0.0 -O1 -mcmodel=large -S a.c

extern void grub_memmove(void);

__attribute__((__target__("bmi2"))) void a_bmi(void) {
  // expect:
  //   movabsq $grub_memmove, %rbx
  //   call    *%rbx
  // actual (bug):
  //   call    grub_memmove
  for (;;)
    grub_memmove();
}
```

Here `gcc` effectively removed **-mcmodel=large** due to presence of
`__attribute__((__target__("bmi2")))` and generated invalid
assembly (`-mcmodel=medium`, assumed `.text` is within 4GB reach).

The fix: `gcc` was fixed not to ignore `-mcmodel=` and friends when
overriding target attributes are used:
<https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=8f1cb70d7ca6a8da7f6bc7f43fb5e758c0ce88b5>

This was a nasty bug. We were lucky that `gcc` managed to generate a
relocation that linker does not understand instead of silently
generating invalid `grub`.

## Other minor `gcc` bugs

A few more smaller bugs if you like that kind of stuff:

- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98753>: `-Wfree-nonheap-object` false
  positive
- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98286>: `g++` accepts `void d(void) {
  typename foo; }` as valid code
- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98306>: `g++` accepts invalid template code
  as valid
- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR97615>: dolphin `ICE` in `SLP` (vectorization
  patterns need a tweak)
- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR96863>: dolphin `varasm` `ICE`
- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR97206>: array type check bug
- <https://sourceware.org/PR27004>: `glibc` `tls` reference bug
- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98403>: `grub` build hangup
- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR98597>: `ICE` in `print_mem_ref`
- <https://gcc.gnu.org/PR97830>: `iCE` in `sccvn`

## Parting words

Running a compiler from a development branch is a lot of fun. Every
compiler upgrade fixed some existing bugs and introduced new ones. It is
important to make sure fixes are intentional and not just masking bugs
by other changes. And always keep a backup ready. You will need it.
Many of the above regressions were not caught with regression tests as
they were frequently not trivial feature interactions. Real world
applications keep surprising `gcc`.

[`gentoo`](https://www.gentoo.org/) makes it very easy to break (and fix!)
your system if you really want it. It's perhaps the primary reason I
keep using it for about 15 years. You might want to give it a try as
well :)

Have fun!
