title: "Linker script weird tricks or EFI on ia64"
date: February 2, 2018
---

One of `gentoo` [bugs](https://bugs.gentoo.org/579278) was about
`gentoo` install `CD` not being able to boot `Itanium` (`ia64`) boxes.

## The bug

The symptom is `EFI` loader error:

``` 
Loading.: Gentoo Linux
ImageAddress: pointer is outside of image
ImageAddress: pointer is outside of image
LoadPe: Section 1 was not loaded
Load of Gentoo Linux failed: Not Found
Paused - press any key to continue
```

This looks like a simple error if you have the hardware and source code
of the loader that prints the error. I had neither.

My plan was to extend `ski` emulator to be able to handle early
`EFI` stuff. I started reading [docs on early `itanium` boot
life](https://www.thailand.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/specification-updates/itanium-system-abstraction-layer-specification.pdf):
on `SAL`s (system abstraction layers), `PAL`s (platform abstraction
layers), monarch processors, rendezvous protocols to handle `MCA`s
(machine check aborts) and expected system state when hand off to
`EFI` happens. But `SAL` spec touches `EFI` only at `SAL` -> `EFI`
interface boundary. I dreaded to open `EFI` spec before finishing reading
`SAL` paper.

## How `ia64` actually boots

Recently I got access to real management processor (sometimes also
called `MP`, `BMC` (baseboard management controller): `iLO`
(integrated lights-out)) on `rx3600` machine and I gave up on
extending `ski` for a while.
The very first thing I attempted is to get to serial console of
operating system from `iLO`. It happened to be not as straightforward
as passing `console=ttyS0` to kernel. I ended up learning a bit about
`EFI` shell, `ia64`-specific [serial port
numbering](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/ia64/serial.txt)
and `elilo`.
Eventually I was able to boot arbitrary kernel directly from `EFI`
shell and get to kernel's console! I needed that as a fallback in case
I screw default boot loader, boot loader config or default boot options
as I don't have physical access to `ia64` machine.
Here is an example of booting from `CD` and controlling it from
`iLO` virtual serial console:

``` 
fs0:\efi\boot\bootia64.efi -i gentoo.igz gentoo initrd=gentoo.igz root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc dokeymap looptype=squashfs loop=/image.squashfs cdroot console=ttyS1,115200n8
```

Here `fs0` is a `FAT` file system (on `CD`, could be on `HDD`) with
`EFI` applications. `bootia64.efi` is a `sys-boot/elilo`
application in disguise. `console=ttyS1,115200n8` matches `EFI` setup
of second serial console.
After successful boot from `CD` of known good old kernel (from 2009) I
was not afraid of messing with main `HDD` install or even upgrading to
brand new kernels, I even managed to squash another `ia64`-specific
kernel and GCC bug! I'll try to write another post about that.
This poking also helped me to understand boot process in more detail.
`ia64` boots in the following way:

1.  `SAL`: when machine powers on it executes `SAL` (and `PAL`)
    code to initialize System and Processors. This code is not
    easily to update and usually stays the same across `OS` updates.
2.  `EFI`: Then `SAL` hands control to `EFI` (also not easily
    to update) where I can interactively pick boot device or even get
    `EFI` shell to run `EFI` applications (programs for `EFI`
    environment).
3.  `Bootloader (EFI application)`: Normally `EFI` is set up to
    start boot loader after a few seconds. It's up to the user
    (finally!) to provide a boot loader implementation. [Gentoo `ia64`
    handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:IA64) suggests
    `sys-boot/elilo` package.
4.  `OS kernel`: boot loader finds `OS` kernel, loads it and hands
    control off to kernel.

## Searching for the clues

Our problem happened at stage `3` where `EFI` failed to load
`elilo` application.
`gentoo` builds `.iso` images automatically and continuously. Here you
can find [`ia64`
isos](http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/ia64/autobuilds/). Older
disks are available on actual builder machines.
As `elilo` used to work on images from 2008 and even `2016` (!) I
passed through a few autobuilt `ISO` images and collected a few
working and non-working samples and started comparing them.
I extracted `elilo.efi` files from 3 disks:

- `elilo-2014-works.efi`: good, picked from machine I have access to
- `elilo-2016-works.efi`: good, picked from `2016` install `CD`
- `elilo-2018-does-not-work.efi`: bad, freshly built on modern
  software

Normally I would start from running `readelf -a` on each executable
and diff for suspicious changes. The files however are not `ELF`s:

``` 
$ file *.efi
elilo-2014-works.efi:         PE32+ executable (EFI application) Intel Itanium (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows
elilo-2016-works.efi:         PE32 executable (EFI application) Intel Itanium (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows
elilo-2018-does-not-work.efi: PE32+ executable (EFI application) Intel Itanium (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows
```

One of them is not even `PE32+` but still happens to boot.
`binutils` has more generic `readelf -a` equivalent: it's
`objdump -x`. Comparing two good files:

There is a lot of odd going on here: the file on 2016 live `CD` is
actually from 2006 and it's actually older than file from 2014. It has
different PE type and as a result different file alignment. Thus I
discarded `elilo-2016-works.efi` as too old.

This looks better. A few notable things:

- `Time/Date` field is not initialized for the bad file: sane date vs.
  all zeros
- `BaseOfCode` looks uninitialized: `0x1000` vs. `0x0000`
- `MinorLinkerVersion` says good file was built with
  `binutils-2.23`, bad file was built with `binutils-2.29`
- File has only 2 relocations: `Number of fixups 2`. We could check
  them manually!
- And a lot of symbols: `570` vs. `580`

I tried to build `elilo` with `binutils-2.25`: it produced the same
binary as `elilo-2018-does-not-work.efi`.
My only clue was that `BaseOfCode` is zero. It felt like something
used to reside in the first page before code section and now it does not
anymore. What could it be?

## GNU `binutils` linker scripts

Time to look at how the decision is made what to put into the first page at
link time!
The build process of `elilo.efi` is truly unusual. Let's run `emerge
-1 sys-boot/elilo` and check what commands are being executed to yield
it:

``` bash
# emerge -1 sys-boot/elilo
...
make -j1 ... ARCH=ia64
...

>>> Source compiled.
```

Here we see the following steps:

- With exception of `-frename-registers -mfixed-range=f32-f127` the
  process of building `EFI` application is almost like building normal
  shared library.
- Non-standard `/usr/lib/elf_ia64_efi.lds` linker script is used.
- `objcopy --target=efi-app-ia64` is used to create `PE32+` file
  out of `ELF64`. Very dark magic.

Luckily `gnu-efi` and `elilo` have [superb
documentation](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnu-efi/code/ci/master/tree/README.gnuefi)
(10 pages). All the obscure corners are explained in every detail.
`Part 2: Inner Workings` is the short description of how every dynamic
linker works with a light touch of `ELF` -> `PE32+` conversion. I
wish I have seen this doc years ago :)
Let's looks at the `elf_ia64_efi.lds` linker script to get full
understanding of where every byte comes from when `elilo.so` is being
linked ([sourceforge
viewer](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnu-efi/code/ci/master/tree/gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds)):

```

Even though the file is very big it's easy to read. Linker script
defines symbols (as `symbol = expression`, `.` (dot) means "current
address") and output section (as *`output-section : { expressions }`)
in terms of input sections.
Here is what linker script tries to achieve:

- `. = 0;` sets load address to `0`. It does not really matter. At
  load time module will be relocated anyway.
- `ImageBase = .` means that the new symbol `ImageBase` is created and
  pointed at current address: the very start of the whole output as
  nothing was collected yet.
- `.hash : { *(.hash) }` means to collect all `DT_HASH` input
  symbol sections into output `DT_HASH` section. `DT_HASH` defines
  mandatory section of fast symbol lookup. Linker uses that section to
  resolve symbol name to symbol type and offset in the file.
- `. = ALIGN(4096)` forces linker to pad output (with zeros) to `4K`
  boundary (`EFI` defines page size as `4K`).
- Only then goes `.text : ...` section. `BaseOfCode` is the very
  first byte of `.text` section.
- Other things go below.

## GNU hash mystery

Later `objcopy` is used to produce final (`PE32+`) binary by copying
whitelisted sections passed via `-j`:

``` 
objcopy -j .text -j .sdata -j .data -j .dynamic -j .dynsym -j .rel \
        -j .rela -j .reloc --target=efi-app-ia64 elilo.so elilo.efi
```

While `objcopy` does not copy `.hash` section into final binary
it's mere presence in `elilo.so` file changes `.text` offset as
linker already allocated space for it in `elilo.so` and resolved other
relocations taking offset into account.
So why offset disappeared? Simple! Because `gentoo` does not generate
`.hash` sections [since 2014](https://bugs.gentoo.org/575300#c20)!
`.gnu.hash` (**DT_GNU_HASH**) is being used instead. `DT_GNU_HASH`
was [added to
binutils/glibc](https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2006-06/msg00418.html)
around 2006 as an optional mechanism to speed up dynamic linking and
dynamic loading.
But linker script does not deal with `.gnu.hash` sections!
It's easy to mimic handling of both section types:

``` diff

This fix alone was enough to restore `elilo.efi`! A few other
architectures did not handle it either. See full [upstream
fix](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnu-efi/code/ci/2cc0b085fb82e80d43cc08c8376dff9f9532a72d/).

## Breakage mechanics

But why does it matter? What does it mean to drop `.hash` section
completely? `PE` format does not have a `.hash` equivalent.
Let's inspect what actually changes in `elilo.so` file before and
after the patch:

```

Here internal `ImageBase` symbol became external symbol! Which means
`EFI` would have to resolve `ImageBase` at application startup.
That's why we have seen loader error (as opposed to `elilo.efi`
runtime errors or kernel boot errors).
`ELF` spec says shared objects and dynamic executables are required to
have `.hash` (or `.gnu.hash`) section to be valid executable but
linker script did not maintain this requirement and all hell broke
loose.
Perhaps linker could be tweaked to report warnings when symbol table is
missing from output file. But as you can see linker scripts are much
more powerful than just implementing fixed output format.

## Fun details

`gnu-efi` has a lot of other jewels!

For example, entry point has to point to `ia64` function descriptor
(`FDESCR`). `FDESCR` is a pair of pointers: pointer to code section
(actual entry point) and value of `gp` register (global pointer, base
pointer used by `PIC` code).
These two pointers are both absolute addresses. But `EFI` application
needs to be relocatable (loadable at different addresses).
Entry point `FDESCR` needs to be relocated by `EFI` loader.
How would you inject `ia64` relocation to two 64-bit pointers in
``PE32+` format? `gnu-efi` does a very crazy thing (even more crazy
than relying on `objcopy` to Just Work)): it injects `PE32+`
relocation directly into `ia64` `ELF` code! That's how it does the
trick (the snippet below is the very tail of [crt0-efi-ia64.S
file](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnu-efi/code/ci/master/tree/gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia64.S)):

``` asm
// PE32+ wants a PLABEL, not the code address of the entry point:
.align 16
.global _start_plabel
.section .plabel, "a"
_start_plabel:
    data8    _start
    data8    __gp

// hand-craft a .reloc section for the plabel:

#define IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64 10

.section .reloc, "a"
    data4    _start_plabel                    // Page RVA
    data4    12                               // Block Size (2*4+2*2)
    data2    (IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64<<12) +  0 // reloc for plabel's entry point
    data2    (IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64<<12) +  8 // reloc for plabel's global pointer
```

This code generates two sections:

- `.plabel` with yet unrelocated `_start` and `_gp` pointers
  (crafts `FDESCR` itself)
- `.reloc` with synthesised raw bytes that look like `PE32+`
  relocation. It's format is slightly more complicated and is defined
  by `PE32+` spec:
  - `[4 bytes]` 32-bit offset to some blob where relocations are to be
    applied, in our case it's `_start_plabel`
  - `[4 bytes]` full size of this relocation entry
  - `[2 bytes * N relocations]` list of tuples: (4 bits for relocation
    type, 12-bit offset to data to relocate)

Here we have two relocations that add `ImageBase`: to `_start` and
to `_gp`. And it's precisely these two relocations that `EFI`
loader reported as invalid:

``` 
ImageAddress: pointer is outside of image
ImageAddress: pointer is outside of image
LoadPe: Section 1 was not loaded
```

Before `.gnu.hash` fix `ImageBase` (`ImageAddress` in `EFI`
terminology) was indeed pointing somewhere else.
How about searching internets for source of this `EFI` loader error?
`tianocore` has [one
hit](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/DuetPkg/EfiLdr/PeLoader.c#L324)
in commented out code:

``` c
//...
Base = EfiLdrPeCoffImageAddress (Image, (UINTN)Section->VirtualAddress);
End = EfiLdrPeCoffImageAddress (Image, (UINTN)(Section->VirtualAddress + Section->Misc.VirtualSize));

if (EFI_ERROR(Status) || !Base || !End) {
//      DEBUG((D_LOAD|D_ERROR, "LoadPe: Section %d was not loaded\n", Index));
    PrintHeader ('L');
      return EFI_LOAD_ERROR;
}
//...
```

Not very useful but still fun :)

## Parting words

`Itanium` was the first system `EFI` was targeted at and was later
morphed into `UEFI`. Surprisingly I managed to ignore `(U)EFI`-based
boot on modern machines and this bug was my first experience to deal
with it. And it was not too bad! :)
I found out a few things along the way:

- `ia64` `EFI` is a rich interface to `OS` and `iLO` to control
  the machine remotely
- Linker scripts can do a lot more than I realized:
  - merge sections
  - discard sections
  - inject symbols
  - handle alignments
  - rename sections
- With certain care `objcopy` can convert binaries across different
  object file formats. In this case `ELF64` to `PE32+`
- Assembler allows you to inject absolutely arbitrary sections into
  object files. Just make sure you handle those in your linker script.
- Modern GNU toolchain still can breathe life into decade old hardware
  to teach us a trick or two.
- `objdump -x` is a cool equivalent of `readelf`.

Have fun!
