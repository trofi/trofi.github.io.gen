title: "xmms2 0.9.2 is out"
date: February 11, 2023

Tl;DR: `xmms2-0.9.2` is out and you can get it at
<https://github.com/xmms2/xmms2-devel/releases/tag/0.9.2>!

[xmms2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMMS2) is still a music player
daemon with various plugins to support stream decoding and
transformation. See
[previous announcement](/posts/244-xmms2-0.9.1-is-out.html) on how to
get started with `xmms2`.

## Highlights

The guest star of this release is `libvisual` plugin!

Apart from that `FLAC` playback hangup
[fix](/posts/274-xmms2-flac-hangup-fix.html) went into the release. The
rest of changes are cosmetic.

## libvisual rabbit hole

In `xmms2-0.9.1` `libvisual` plugin did no work for me. I did not pay
attention to that until Sebastian sent the
[PR #15](https://github.com/xmms2/xmms2-devel/pull/15) that fixes render
stutter when player is on pause. I was not able to verify the fix and
accepted the PR as is. The change looked reasonable. A while after
Sebastian helped me to debug problems on my system and rule out the
video subsystem.

Quiz question: why do you think `libvisual` did not work for me? Was it
a misconfiguration on my side? A bug in `xmms2` or somewhere else in
it's dependencies?

[libvisual](https://github.com/Libvisual/libvisual) is a library to
visualize your music! If you remember the times of Media Player in
Windows 98 it's that kind of visualization.

There are various plugins that render different videos. An example may
look this way: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAM-lhiSYcY>.

`xmms2` provides `xmms2-libvisual` client application that you can run
and see the visualization. In theory you can just run it and
get the result:

```
$ xmms2-libvisual
Controls: Arrow keys switch between plugins, TAB toggles fullscreen, ESC quits.
          Each plugin can has its own mouse/key bindings, too.
Note: you can give your favourite libvisual plugin as command line argument.
<hung>
```

But in my case nothing happened: the client app just hung.

By running `strace` over it I noticed that `xmms2-libvisual` used `UDP`
protocol to connect to server. That was unusual. I expected `xmms2` to
use shared memory when ran on a local machine.

This was an `xmmsclient` bug: as some point build system stopped
enabling `semtimedop()` presence and always fell back to `UDP`.
Restoring `semtimedop()` was
[easy](https://github.com/xmms2/xmms2-devel/commit/3d737ed05f8bb7d4449042d617e830f03774bc50):
we needed to set `HAVE_SEMTIMEDOP` define in visualization client:

         )
```

After the fix the error changed:

```
$ xmms2-libvisual

          Each plugin can has its own mouse/key bindings, too.
Note: you can give your favourite libvisual plugin as command line argument.
Available plugins:
Error: Actor plugin not found!
```

This happens because `libvisual` itself does not render images without
plugins. And it does not provide any default plugins. I needed to
install `libvisual-plugins` to get something to render!

Due to some specifics of `nixpkgs` there is no easy way to share plugin
load path by both `libvisual` and `libvisual-plugins`. To work it around
I added a
[--libvisual-plugins flag](https://github.com/xmms2/xmms2-devel/commit/749bb0c0f4b45230501a5893eb1cebe659b3bcb7)
to be able to load it from arbitrary location.

After that I got empty window. Sebastian helped me with that by
configuring `VIS` output:

```
$ xmms2 server config effect.order.0 = visualization
```

And I got the video back:

Yay!

Later I returned to `UDP` protocol. It ought to work! I added a
[bit of logging](https://github.com/xmms2/xmms2-devel/commit/7ab91c1ec1ba2ff2cd681ac19a80bea957d3fc28)
to see if client gets anything from the server:

 	} while (diffc < 10);

```

`fflush ()` confirmed that server did not answer to client's requests:

```
$ xmms2-libvisual
...
Syncing UDP time <cursror here>
```

This hangup happens due to an interesting case of handling dual-stack
`IPv4+IPv6` setup this machine has:

- clients usually try to connect to `IPv4` first, then `IPv6` (following
  sequence of `getaddrinfo()` results)
- servers on the other hand try to bind to `IPv4` first, then `IPv6`.

As a result `IPv6` client was failing to connect `IPv4` server on the
same machine.

The fix is straightforward: server should bind not to the first
`getaddrinfo()` address, but all the `getaddrinfo()` addresses. The only
caveat is that binding on `IPv6+IPv4` fails if `IPv4` was already bound.
Setting `IPV6_V6ONLY` allowed disabling dual-stack default on bound
socket.

[The change](https://github.com/xmms2/xmms2-devel/commit/d9d64c1d303593205251494ea4c8847174dd5e9b)
is a bit long as it added support for multiple server sockets in the
event loop. It's gist is around:

```

After the change I got working visualization over `UDP` a swell.

## libvisual UDP protocol

While debugging stuck `visualization` stream I got the following picture
of how `visual` `UDP` clients are expected to interact with `xmms2`
server on the wire level:

1. First `xmms2-libvisual` connects over `TCP` (or UNIX socket) to
   `xmms2` server using standard `XMMS_PATH` environment variable. Let's
   call it "control channel" socket.
2. Then over over "control channel" client sends a
   `visualization.register()` RPC and gets the numeric ID back. At this
   point client does not know if it's an `SHM` or `UDP` transport.
3. Then client tries to open an `SHM` object with this numeric ID by
   sending `visualization.init_shm(id)` RPC. If it fails client falls back
   to try `UDP` instead.
4. The client sends `visualization.init_udp(id)` RPC.
5. As a response to client RPC server opens `UDP` socket on a fixed
   `9667` port and waits for incoming messages.

Now client and server are ready to negotiate VIS-specific `UDP` channel.
There are a few types of messages that pass arhound:

- 'H' message (hearbeat): `"H<id>"` (5 bytes)
- 'V' message (data): `"V<grace><server-ts><size><samples>"` (up to 4k)
- 'T' message (sync): `"T<id><cilent-ts><server-ts>"` (21 bytes)
- 'K' message (disconnect): `"K"` (1 byte)

`Timestamps` are 8 bytes long and consist of a par of 2 values:
4 bytes for seconds and 4 bytes for nanoseconds. Each data `sample` is a
16-bit value. Usually of PCM format.

`UDP` side of the protocol looks like that:

- client -> server: sends `"H<id>"` packet to announce it's presence.
- client -> server: sends `"T<id><client-ts><server-ts>"` to synchronize
  time difference and start tracking client staleness.
- server -> client: responds with the same
  `"T<id><client-ts><server-ts>"` type of packet.
- server -> client: periodically send
  `"V<server-ts><format><size><samples>"` data where 'samples' contain
  an array of PCM values, usually 2048 entries. For 44100Hz
  that would cover for about 20ms of data.
- server -> client: Eventually client stops sending sync messages ('T')
  and server sends `"K"` message and cleans up client handling.

It's not a very robust or secure protocol. But it's so simple. It allows
for multiple parallel visualization clients to co-exist.

## Parting words

`xmms2` is back with `libvisual` support! `VIS` protocol is not very
complicated.

To answer the quiz question above the problem was in all of the proposed
cases:

- `xmms2` did not use `UNIXSHM` for `visualization` and fell back to
  `UDP`
- `xmms2` did not bind to both `IPv4`+`IPv6` sockets on dual-stack
  system.
- `nixpkgs` did not provide `libvisual-plugins` in any form. A required
  dependency to show anything.
- I did not configure `xmms2` server to have a `visualization` sink.

After fixing all of the above I hope more people will be able to play
with `libvisual`.

Have fun!
