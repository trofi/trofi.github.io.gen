title: "fontconfig on 160 DPI"
date: March 25, 2023

## Tl;DR

If you got garbled fonts after a recent update of `nixos-unstable`
consider dropping `HiDPI` flag in your configuration. It is usually one
of these:

```nix
hardware.video.hidpi.enable = true;
fonts.optimizeForVeryHighDPI = true;
```

If you recently followed a rename from `hardware.video.hidpi.enable` to
`fonts.optimizeForVeryHighDPI` and your monitor is below 200 DPI you are
probably still affected.

If your device has a `subpixel` format more complicated that vertical or
horizontal RGB you might want to disable `subpixel` rendering entirely:

```nix
fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.rgba = "none";
fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.lcdfilter = "none";
```

If your fonts don't contain reasonable hints for rasterization try
`freetype` `autohint`:

```nix
fonts.fontconfig.hinting.autohint = true;
```

## The problem

A few days ago the change landed to `nixpkgs` to disable fonts
[anti-aliasing](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/f03716715f663f1c45056b7df450cf1b7386181b)
via `nixpkgs` template for `fontconfig` configuration.

The change claimed that on 200+ DPI monitors anti-aliasing is not
detectable.
Unfortunately my monitor was a bit below 200 DPI and I noticed degraded
font quality after an upgrade.
My monitor has ~160 physical DPI which I configure as 192 DPI for
simplicity (exactly 2x scale of default 96 DPI). Typical `wayland`
clients like `firefox` and `alacritty` are smart enough to perform
actual rendering into unscaled (device pixel-perfect) surface using
2x of original font point size. The result is nice looking fonts.

## Bogus `HiDPI` setting

So why am I even getting `HiDPI` setting then if I'm just below 200 DPI?
It used to work before. What changed?
The `hardware.video.hidpi.enable` flag in my
`/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix` `NixOS` configuration came from
`NixOS` installer when I first installed the system:

```nix
# /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
# ...
# Do not modify this file!  It was generated by ‘nixos-generate-config’
# and may be overwritten by future invocations.  Please make changes
# to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix instead.
{ config, lib, pkgs, modulesPath, ... }:
{
# ...
  # high-resolution display
  hardware.video.hidpi.enable = lib.mkDefault true;
}
```

It's a small auto-generated file. The above snippet comes from this
bit of `perl` of the installer:

```perl
# From nixos/modules/installer/tools/nixos-generate-config.pl
# ...
# For lack of a better way to determine it, guess whether we should use a
# bigger font for the console from the display mode on the first
# framebuffer. A way based on the physical size/actual DPI reported by
# the monitor would be nice, but I don't know how to do this without X :)
my $fb_modes_file = "/sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes";
if (-f $fb_modes_file && -r $fb_modes_file) {
    my $modes = read_file($fb_modes_file);
    $modes =~ m/([0-9]+)x([0-9]+)/;
    my $console_width = $1, my $console_height = $2;
    if ($console_width > 1920) {
        push @attrs, "# high-resolution display";
        push @attrs, 'hardware.video.hidpi.enable = lib.mkDefault true;';
    }
}
```

My system has the following value:

```
$ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes
U:3840x2160p-0
```

Thus, `perl` snippet above triggers a `HiDPI` setting based on pixel
width. Unfortunately my physical screen width is 620mm (~24 inches).
This makes it a 160 DPI screen.
According to the code comment `HiDPI` was enabled mainly for font size
in the kernel console and does not say much about `Xorg` or `wayland`
clients.

Am I supposed to regenerate that file periodically?
`man nixos-generate-config` says that `hardware-configuration.nix` file
does not normally gets regenerated and one has to run the script after
any hardware changes are made. I don't remember ever doing that.

After numerous reports around broken fonts `nixos-generate-config` was
fixed with
[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/222236](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/4787ebf7ae2ab071389be7ff86cf38edeee7e9f8)
to stop inferring (incorrectly) that option for users.
Thus new users' installs should not get `HiDPI` for hardware like mine.
Yay!

## Confusing option rename

The initial change also got the other problem: it did not suggest users to
remove the option from `hardware-configuration.nix`. It suggested to
transition it to another option: `fonts.optimizeForVeryHighDPI`.
It feels natural for people to mechanically switch from `hidpi.enable`
to `fonts.optimizeForVeryHighDPI` assuming they have the same semantic.
Both are about `HiDPI`, right? At least that is what I did initially :)
No. `hidpi.enable` used to mean `> 1920` width. `VeryHighDPI` means
physical 200+ DPI. If you are lucky to get into an intersection of both
(or neither) then you will not notice the change.

## Actual effect

Given that `fontconfig` usually reads its configuration at program
startup I was able run the same `alacritty` application side by side
before and after the `fontconfig` change.

![no anti-aliasing vs anti-aliasing](/posts.data/283-fontconfig-on-160-DPI/aa-vs-no-aa.png)

Both  lines feel almost the same. Can you spot the difference? The
difference is even more visible when we zoom in a bit.
As original [`PR #194594`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/194594)
did not contain too many details I was not sure if my system was
incorrectly configured or the change had a bug and unintentionally degraded my
fonts.
My first workaround was to flip all the `fontconfig` options back on:

```nix
{ ... }:
{
  # Fix aliasing until it's fixed in:
  #   https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/194594
  fonts.fontconfig.antialias = true;
  fonts.fontconfig.hinting.enable = true;
  fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.lcdfilter = "default";
  fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.rgba = "rgb";
}
```

That allowed me to restore previous behavior and continue the
experiments.

I disabled output scaling (`wlr-randr --output ... --scale 1`) and
manually set 2x font sizes in a few `wayland` applications. Nothing
changed compared to `--scale 2` (good!). Applications generated
identical font output. Bringing font anti-aliasing back restored font
look and feel.

I never really knew what these knobs do. I took it as an opportunity to
explore it in a bit more detail the get the idea if I still need them
and if I can do any adjustments to them.

I used to use similar knobs in `gentoo` as well on 96 DPI monitor and
was a happy user. The only caveat is that I was a user of `Terminus`
font in the terminals. And that is a pixel-perfect bitmap font: it always
disables anti-aliasing and `subpixel` rendering. For other applications
I used default fonts and occasionally `Comic Sans`. There `fontconfig`
changes did show the difference.

Nowadays I use `Liberation Mono` font (`11.5pt`) in `alacritty`. And it
looked reasonable until the regression.

## `freetype` algorithms

So what do these options do? I found a nice visual explanation for some
of them [here](https://mrandri19.github.io/2019/08/08/modern-text-rendering-linux-ep2.html):

1. `antialias` uses various brightness of white to simulate smoother
   curves on pixel grid. Probably the most important option to get the
   smooth curves. And the source of "blurred" effect when done
   wrong.
2. `subpixel` rendering exploits the fact that each LCD monitors' pixel
   consists of `subpixels` (pixels within pixel!) of a particular color
   (`Red`, `Green`, `Blue`) which you can manipulate separately.

On top of that `freetype` implements a few more algorithms:

3. `LCD` filtering to restore "white" color after `subpixel` rendering.
4. font rasterization `hinting` to coerce fonts to fit better into pixel
   grid by sacrificing rasterization correctness in favor of less blur.

### Anti-aliasing

[mrandri19.github.io](https://mrandri19.github.io/2019/08/08/modern-text-rendering-linux-ep2.html)
contains the effect of both grayscale anti-aliasing and `subpixel`
anti-aliasing.

Anti-aliasing sounds straightforward: use varying brightness to simulate
smooth boundaries. As long as you can still distinguish individual pixels
on the monitor you will clearly see the effect. And even if you don't
chances are that text without anti-aliasing will look less even (jumping
letter height).

### `subpixel` rendering

`subpixel` rendering is less intuitive: it relies on the fact that each
pixel in many LCD monitors contains many distinct `Red`, `Green` and
`Blue` sections in different parts of the pixel (`subpixels`). There are
various `subpixel` patterns used for different devices.

The simplest of is vertical `RGB`. This topology is conveyed to
`freetype` via `fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.rgba = "rgb";` `NixOS` option.

![vertical RGB from geometrian.com](https://geometrian.com/programming/reference/subpixelzoo/square_RGB_sm.png)

In this case use of `subpixel` rendering increases rendering resolution 3
times! But only in horizontal dimension (and with coloring caveats).
Each `subpixel` intensity is set by pixel's `RGB` values from 0 to 256.
For example, you can light only `66%` of the `subpixel` by `#00FFFF` color. It
is magic.

What I did not realize is that rotating your monitor 90 degrees you will
probably slightly "break" your rendering as `fontconfig` will assume the
same vertical bars. But the rotation makes it horizontal! Ideally
configuration would have to change to `fonts.fontconfig.subpixel.rgba = "vrgb";`.

And having two monitors setup attached to a single machine with
different rotations makes it even more interesting.

This also means that lossless `.png` screenshots made on a system with
one `subpixel` order will be rendered differently on a system with
another `subpixel` order. This means that sharing screenshots might not
be very convincing to explain the rendering degradation. But the
zoom into the picture should make things less dependent on `subpixels`.

The good news is that `subpixel` rendering might not be as noticeable for
120+ DPI devices. At least I did not manage to detect my `subpixel`
layout using <http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/subpixel.php> on any of the
monitors I had (lowest was 100 DPI).

Vertical RGB `subpixel` layout is not the only available format.
<https://geometrian.com/programming/reference/subpixelzoo/index.php>
lists 26 formats. Some of them are rotations. But some of them use
`subpixels` that overlap with multiple pixels. That makes rendering even
more interesting problem. For example on some OLED displays `subpixels`
are a lot more complicated: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PenTile_matrix_family>.
`freetype`'s `subpixel` render as a library seems to be able to handle
some formats by specifying
[`subpixel` geometry](https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-lcd_rendering.html).

I'm not sure `fontconfig` allows you to specify it via `/etc/fonts`.
[`Issue #63`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig/-/issues/63)
suggests there is no support for it yet. The good news is that DPI of
those devices is usually very high and `subpixel` details are harder to
notice.

This means that if your display device has something more complicated
that a form of vertical or horizontal RGB you might want to disable
`subpixel` rendering entirely as will not do any good.

### LCD filtering

In addition to that `freetype` also implement LCD filtering to restore
"white" color after exploiting `subpixels` when rendering "white" font.
LCD filter once again uses knowledge of `subpixel` shape to restore color
balance: <https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-lcd_rendering.html>.

### Font hinting

And the last but not least is the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting>
which embeds hints on how to better adjust fonts to pixel grid when
rasterized. Very old `TTF` fonts have hints only for `640x480` monitors and
thus look awful when those hints are followed. `FreeType` implements a
few hinting algorithms. One of them ignores font hints entirely and
constructs some reasonable form itself:
<https://freetype.org/autohinting/hinter.html>. On `NixOS` it can be
enabled with `fonts.fontconfig.hinting.autohint = true;`.

## Parting words

Fonts are hard, exciting, and fun!

If you got garbled fonts on `NixOS` recently then try to disable
`hardware.video.hidpi.enable` and `fonts.optimizeForVeryHighDPI`
settings if you device is under 200 physical DPI. Otherwise, you might
want to explore your type of LCD screen and tweak `subpixel` rendering:
either disable it entirely or tweak it to match hardware.

Text screenshots might look differently on screens of the same size if
`subpixel` layout differs among them (if screen is rotated or pixel
technology leads to a different layout).

Having spent some time tweaking fonts for this post I decided to give
`Roboto Mono` another chance. Let's see if it will be on par with
`Liberation Mono`.

While at it, I enabled `fonts.fontconfig.hinting.autohint = true;`
to see if [`autohint`](http://freetype.org/autohinting/hinter.html) makes
font rendering better on fonts without explicit hints for popular pixel
sizes.

Have fun!
