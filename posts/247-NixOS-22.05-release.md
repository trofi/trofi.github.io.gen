Last month NixOS-22.05 release [came out](https://nixos.org/blog/announcements.html#nixos-22.05).
If you never seent it you should give it a try: <https://nixos.org/download.html#nixos-iso>.

I took the release event as a good excude to share a few tips.

# Nicer logs

Nix is full of boring paths with long prefixes like
**/nix/store/xk0rdw0sj3ysnjyh90z85mlx3w0kab5s-coreutils-full-9.1/bin/ls**.
It's a lot longer than **/usr/bin/ls**. But with all the noise it contains
useful hint that **ls** comes from **coreutils** package.

```
$ ls -l /run/current-system/sw/bin/ls
lrwxrwxrwx 9 root root 69 Jan  1  1970 /run/current-system/sw/bin/ls -> /nix/store/xk0rdw0sj3ysnjyh90z85mlx3w0kab5s-coreutils-full-9.1/bin/ls
```

To save some space and keep useful detail I'm using **~/bin/unnix** one-liner:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

sed -r 's@/nix/store/[0-9a-z]{32}-@/<<NIX>>/@g'
```

It leaves out hashes but not package names or versions:

```
$ ls -l /run/current-system/sw/bin/ls |& unnix
lrwxrwxrwx 9 root root 69 Jan  1  1970 /run/current-system/sw/bin/ls -> /<<NIX>>/coreutils-full-9.1/bin/ls
```

I frequently use **unnix** to compare build logs from different environments.

# Running binaries from arbitrary nixpkgs commits

Normally you can pull in a program in your environment by installing
it. Or by running it directly:

```
$ nix run nixpkgs#re2c -- --version
re2c 3.0
```

But sometimes it's useful to run a program from a specific commit
of a repository. Flake syntax allows you to do it as is:

```
$ nix run github:NixOS/nixpkgs/4a7f99d55d299453a9c2397f90b33d1120669775#re2c -- --version
re2c 1.3
```

With GitHub's synthetic branches you can even run tools right from yet unmerged
PRs against **nixpkgs**:

```
# Use firefox from (then) yet unmerged PR: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/175618
$ nix run github:NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/175618/merge#firefox
```

Be careful to review the commit first. You are running something that is not yet a
part of **nixpkgs** proper.

# Pulling cross-compiler environments with pkgsCross

**nixpkgs** has a **pkgsCross.\*** package prefix with a ton of cross-compilers available.
It makes portability related work a breeze. We can pull the cross-compiler in with
a simple **nix develop** run:

```
$ nix develop nixpkgs#pkgsCross.mingw32.re2c
$ dev>LANG=C i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -v |& unnix
Using built-in specs.
COLLECT_GCC=/<<NIX>>/i686-w64-mingw32-stage-final-gcc-debug-10.3.0/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc
COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/<<NIX>>/i686-w64-mingw32-stage-final-gcc-debug-10.3.0/libexec/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/10.3.0/lto-wrapper
Target: i686-w64-mingw32
Configured with:
Thread model: mcf
Supported LTO compression algorithms: zlib
gcc version 10.3.0 (GCC)
```

# Mass updates for maintained packages

I have a bunch if local packages I occasionally update.
**nixpkgs** has a script to update them automatically:

```
# run from nixpkgs checkout:
$ nix-shell maintainers/scripts/update.nix --argstr maintainer trofi --arg include-overlays true
Going to be running update for following packages:
 - CorsixTH-unstable-2022-05-23
 - dwarffs-unstable-2022-03-06
 - multitextor-unstable-2022-04-22
 - seekwatcher-0.14
 - ski-unstable-2022-04-18
 - vcmi-unstable-2022-05-28

Press Enter key to continue...

Running update for:
 - CorsixTH-unstable-2022-05-23: UPDATING ...

 - multitextor-unstable-2022-04-22: UPDATING ...

 - vcmi-unstable-2022-05-28: DONE.
```

Now all it takes is to build/run the packages to see if things still work.
We got 2 updates ready to commit as is:

```
$ LANG=C git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   vcmi/default.nix

$ nix build -f. corsix-th vcmi

$ LANG=C ls -l | unnix

```

Ready to be committed.
