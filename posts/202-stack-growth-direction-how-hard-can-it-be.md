title: "stack growth direction: how hard can it be?"
date: June 26, 2017
---

This is another horror story with lots of technical details on how
`glibc` was unhappy (again!) on `ia64`.
A week ago I've decided to give `ia64` more love in `gentoo` by
cleaning up backlog of bugs related to `ia64` team:
[hotlist](https://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?email2=ia64%40gentoo.org&emailassigned_to2=1&emailcc2=1&emailtype2=substring&list_id=3571042&order=opendate%2Cbug_id&query_format=advanced&resolution=---)
The backlog was not too large: about 150 bugs.

## ruby garbage collection bug

Many bugs were blocked on [`SIGSEGV`ing
`ruby`](https://bugs.gentoo.org/561780).
The curious fact is that `ruby-2.1.9` used to work on `ia64` and
broke at some point. These kinds of bugs (as opposed to bring software
support for the first time) are usually easy to fix. Something got
slightly off and exposed a `SIGSEGV`. We need to find that something and
tweak it a tiny bit.
Let's look at the `SIGSEGV` (it happens as you compile `ruby` on
`ia64`):

```

```

I've added a bunch of `printf` calls into `ruby` runtime to figure
out where `NULL` pointer dereference comes from. It became immediately
obvious: one of `ia64`-specific pointers was not initialized and kept
default `NULL`.
While I was adding `printf` calls I've noticed a lot of `#ifdef
__ia64` in every place that deals with threads: thread creation,
thread switch, garbage collection. I had almost no idea what code is
supposed to do but very basic understanding of how garbage collection
works suggested variable `native_main_thread.register_stack_start`
should never be `NULL` on `ia64`.
Cooking up the fix was trivial (proposed [pull request
upstream](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/1625)):

```

The fix is to move initialization code before exit from function happens.
I think `ruby_init_stack` used to work because
`MAINSTACKADDR_AVAILABLE` was not defined in older `glibc`. Perhaps
due to missing `HAVE_PTHREAD_GETATTR_NP` support or something similar.
See how complicate detection of `STACKADDR_AVAILABLE` is:

``` c
#if defined HAVE_PTHREAD_GETATTR_NP || defined HAVE_PTHREAD_ATTR_GET_NP
#    define STACKADDR_AVAILABLE 1
#elif defined HAVE_PTHREAD_GET_STACKADDR_NP && defined HAVE_PTHREAD_GET_STACKSIZE_NP
#    define STACKADDR_AVAILABLE 1
#    undef MAINSTACKADDR_AVAILABLE
#    define MAINSTACKADDR_AVAILABLE 1
void *pthread_get_stackaddr_np(pthread_t);
size_t pthread_get_stacksize_np(pthread_t);
#elif defined HAVE_THR_STKSEGMENT || defined HAVE_PTHREAD_STACKSEG_NP
#    define STACKADDR_AVAILABLE 1
#elif defined HAVE_PTHREAD_GETTHRDS_NP
#    define STACKADDR_AVAILABLE 1
#elif defined __HAIKU__
#    define STACKADDR_AVAILABLE 1
#elif defined __ia64 && defined _HPUX_SOURCE
#    include <sys/dyntune.h>
...
```

But now `STACKADDR_AVAILABLE` is defined and `goto bound_check`
skips `native_main_thread.register_stack_start` initialization
completely.
My patch worked and I was happy. But still it was slightly confusing to
see all that `ia64`-specific code for stack handling. What is so
special about it's stack?
Let's look at a code example in `cont.c` file that scans stack for
heap pointers:

``` c
static void
cont_mark(void *ptr)
{
    rb_context_t *cont = ptr;

    RUBY_MARK_ENTER("cont");
    rb_gc_mark(cont->value);

    rb_thread_mark(&cont->saved_thread);
    rb_gc_mark(cont->saved_thread.self);

    if (cont->vm_stack) {
#ifdef CAPTURE_JUST_VALID_VM_STACK
        rb_gc_mark_locations(cont->vm_stack,
                             cont->vm_stack + cont->vm_stack_slen + cont->vm_stack_clen);
#else
        rb_gc_mark_locations(cont->vm_stack,
                             cont->vm_stack, cont->saved_thread.stack_size);
#endif
    }

    if (cont->machine.stack) {
        if (cont->type == CONTINUATION_CONTEXT) {
            /* cont */
            rb_gc_mark_locations(cont->machine.stack,
                                 cont->machine.stack + cont->machine.stack_size);
        } else {
            /* fiber */
            rb_thread_t *th;
            rb_fiber_t *fib = (rb_fiber_t*)cont;
            GetThreadPtr(cont->saved_thread.self, th);
            if ((th->fiber != fib) && fib->status == RUNNING) {
                rb_gc_mark_locations(cont->machine.stack,
                                     cont->machine.stack + cont->machine.stack_size);
            }
        }
    }
#ifdef __ia64
    if (cont->machine.register_stack) {
        rb_gc_mark_locations(cont->machine.register_stack,
                             cont->machine.register_stack + cont->machine.register_stack_size);
    }
#endif

    RUBY_MARK_LEAVE("cont");
}
```

Additional code under `#ifdef __ia64` looked unusual but it didn't
seem to harm any `ruby` tests and I moved on.

## `binutils` out-of-bounds bug

Next bug was lurking in `binutils-2.28` package which occasionally
[crashed `strip`
program](https://sourceware.org/PR21669). In my
case crash was happening only when I was building `gcc`. `gcc`
build system happens to call `strip` binary when compares `stage2`
and `stage3` as one of stages was built with debugging sections (using
`-gtoggle` switch).
The `strip` `SIGSEGV` fix was also surprisingly trivial and not
directly related to stack (or even `ia64`) specifics ([upstream
commit](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commitdiff;h=5cc4ca837deac7dc962d8a3741aa120c50ab41da)):

```

Here a mysterious `hint` was used to refer to out-of-bounds area and
that caused `SIGSEGV`. My guess why it triggered mostly on `ia64`
is because `ia64` has many more `ELF`-sections than other
architectures (`160` versus `32`).

## `glibc` `pthread_create` bug

The next failure happened for `glibc-2.24` package (`glibc-2.23`
worked fine). It looked like every threaded program crashed around
program shutdown ([upstream bug](https://sourceware.org/PR21672)).
That small reproducer was enough to make program crash:

``` c
// how to crash: gcc -O0 -ggdb3 -o r bug.c -pthread && ./r

#include <pthread.h>

static void * f (void * p)
{
    return NULL;
}

int main (int argc, const char ** argv)
{
    pthread_t t;
    pthread_create (&t, NULL, &f, NULL);

    pthread_join (t, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

Here we create a no-op thread and wait for it's shutdown. The
`SIGSEGV` happened at address `0x8` (another `NULL`-pointer
dereference). Backtrace was not very informative:

``` 
$ gcc -O0 -ggdb3 -o r bug.c -pthread && ./r
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

This crash did not make much sense. At first I thought it was caused by
`pd->stackblock` code where `pd` was somehow turned into `NULL`.
But if we look a few lines above ([source
link](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/pthread_create.c;h=7a970ffc5bc6123bbad7d2e38e974ffd2bf859f9;hb=3f823e87ccbf3723eb4eeb63b0619f1a0ceb174e#l561))
`pd` is used in that function all over the places. `strace` run also
suggested that crash happened after `madvise` syscall returned
successfully (`pd->stackblock` has a sane value).
The whole [`start_thread`
function](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/pthread_create.c;h=7a970ffc5bc6123bbad7d2e38e974ffd2bf859f9;hb=3f823e87ccbf3723eb4eeb63b0619f1a0ceb174e#l378)
is quite large but very straightforward. It does tree main things:

1.  setup environment for current thread: locale data, `futex
    robust_lists` (efficient `mutex` runtime support), signal masks
2.  run user's code with this one line: `THREAD_SETMEM (pd, result,
    pd->start_routine (pd->arg));`
3.  teardown environment: call thread-local destructors, call `futex
    robust_lists` and free thread's stack

Our crash happens in `3. teardown environment` phase right at the
place of thread's stack teardown.
`glibc` stack teardown is interesting: it does not free all the stack
because code responsible for stack cleanup uses that very same stack.
Let's look at the code in detail:

```c
/*   Mark the memory of the stack as usable to the kernel.  We free
     everything except for the space used for the TCB itself.  */
  size_t pagesize_m1 = __getpagesize () - 1;
#ifdef _STACK_GROWS_DOWN
  char *sp = CURRENT_STACK_FRAME;
  size_t freesize = (sp - (char *) pd->stackblock) & ~pagesize_m1;
  assert (freesize < pd->stackblock_size);
  if (freesize > PTHREAD_STACK_MIN)
    __madvise (pd->stackblock, freesize - PTHREAD_STACK_MIN, MADV_DONTNEED);
#else
  /* Page aligned start of memory to free (higher than or equal
     to current sp plus the minimum stack size).  */
  void *freeblock = (void*)((size_t)(CURRENT_STACK_FRAME
                                     + PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
                                     + pagesize_m1)
                                    & ~pagesize_m1);
  char *free_end = (char *) (((uintptr_t) pd - pd->guardsize) & ~pagesize_m1);
  /* Is there any space to free?  */
  if (free_end > (char *)freeblock)
    {
      size_t freesize = (size_t)(free_end - (char *)freeblock);
      assert (freesize < pd->stackblock_size);
      __madvise (freeblock, freesize, MADV_DONTNEED);
    }
#endif
```

Here we see two major branches: `_STACK_GROWS_DOWN` and the `#else`
one (not used on `ia64`). `pd` knows precisely where thread's stack
resides: it's in `[pd->stackblock, pd->stackblock +
pd->stackblock_size)` range. `_STACK_GROWS_DOWN` means that stack
starts at address around `pd->stackblock + pd->stackblock_size` and
grows in backward direction (to clarify: stack pointer decreases when
value is pushed to stack).
So far so good, no magic here. `x86_64` does the same.

## First clue

But why `madvise()` affects anyting? Isn't it just a hint to
kernel's memory that can't go wrong even if you messed up the
arguments?
Does page deallocation happen at all? It's just a `madvise` after
all. From `man 2 madvise`:

``` 
Conventional advice values

    The  advice  values  listed below allow an application to tell the kernel how it expects to use
    some mapped or shared memory areas, so that the kernel can choose  appropriate  read-ahead  and
    caching  techniques.   These  advice  values  do not influence the semantics of the application
    (except in the case of MADV_DONTNEED), but may influence its performance.  All  of  the  advice
    values  listed here have analogs in the POSIX-specified posix_madvise(3) function, and the val‐
    ues have the same meanings, with the exception of MADV_DONTNEED.

    MADV_DONTNEED
           Do  not  expect access in the near future.  (For the time being, the application is fin‐
           ished with the given range, so the kernel can free resources associated with it.)

           After a successful MADV_DONTNEED operation, the semantics of memory access in the speci‐
           fied  region  are  changed:  subsequent accesses of pages in the range will succeed, but
           will result in either repopulating the memory contents from the up-to-date  contents  of
           the  underlying  mapped  file  (for shared file mappings, shared anonymous mappings, and
           shmem-based techniques such as System V shared memory segments)  or  zero-fill-on-demand
           pages for anonymous private mappings.

           Note  that,  when  applied to shared mappings, MADV_DONTNEED might not lead to immediate
           freeing of the pages in the range.  The kernel is free to delay freeing the pages  until
           an appropriate moment.  The resident set size (RSS) of the calling process will be imme‐
           diately reduced however.

           MADV_DONTNEED cannot be applied to locked pages, Huge TLB  pages,  or  VM_PFNMAP  pages.
           (Pages  marked with the kernel-internal VM_PFNMAP flag are special memory areas that are
           not managed by the virtual memory subsystem.  Such pages are typically created by device
           drivers that map the pages into user space.)
```

`Tl;DR` variant: `madvise(p, size, MADV_DONTNEED)` works as `memset(p,
0, size)`. And it's the only `advice` value that changes program
semantics.

That was the first clue: perhaps we are zeroing out some crucial data
structure? I've commented out `__madvise` call and `SIGSEGV`
disappeared!
I've decided to check if `ia64` is an indeed a `_STACK_GROWS_DOWN`
platform:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

static void g(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f)
{
    int v;
    printf ("sp   = %p\n", &v);
}

static void * f (void * p)
{
    int v;
    printf ("sp   = %p\n", &v);
    g(1,2,3,4,5,6);

    return NULL;
}

int main (int argc, const char ** argv)
{
    printf ("page = %u\n", getpagesize());

    pthread_t t;
    pthread_create (&t, NULL, &f, NULL);

    pthread_join (t, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

``` 
$ ia64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 -ggdb3 -o stack stack.c -pthread && ./stack
page = 65536
sp   = 0x2000000000b7e860
sp   = 0x2000000000b7e830
...
madvise(start=0x20000000003b0000, len=0x790000, flags=0x4)
```

We see a few facts here:

- stack indeed grows by decreasing `sp` (aka `_STACK_GROWS_DOWN`)
- `ia64` pages are 64K
- madvise does not touch `sp` itself and stops at 3 pages away
  (`PTHREAD_STACK_MIN` value): `0x20000000003b0000 + 0x790000 =
  0x2000000000B40000`

So why do things fail? I've tried to add more debug statements into
kernel's `sys_madvise` implementation and ran it under [`ski`
emulator](/posts/199-ia64-machine-emulation.html).
`SIGSEGV` was still reproducible.
Then I've recalled strange `bsp` business and additional stack area
tracked by `ruby` garbage collector. I wondered where that additional
memory region resides:

``` c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

static void g(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f)
{
    int v;
    printf ("sp   = %p\n", &v);
    printf ("bsp  = %p\n", __builtin_ia64_bsp());
}

static void * f (void * p)
{
    int v;
    printf ("sp   = %p\n", &v);
    printf ("bsp  = %p\n", __builtin_ia64_bsp());
    g(1,2,3,4,5,6);

    return NULL;
}

int main (int argc, const char ** argv)
{
    pthread_t t;
    pthread_create (&t, NULL, &f, NULL);

    pthread_join (t, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

``` 
$ ia64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -O0 -ggdb3 -o stack2 stack2.c -pthread && ./stack2
$ ./stack2
sp   = 0x2000000000b7e860
bsp  = 0x2000000000380090
sp   = 0x2000000000b7e830
bsp  = 0x20000000003800b8
madvise(start=0x20000000003b0000, len=0x790000, flags=0x4)
```

See what happens here? `sp` and `bsp` grow from opposite directions
of stack block towards one another both staring the same stack area:

``` 
+--------------------------+
| bsp_start:  0x2...3b0000 |
| ...                      |
| bsp:        0x2...3800b8 |
+--------------------------+
| ....                     |
| guard page: 0x2...770000 |
| ....                     |
+--------------------------+
| sp:         0x2...b7e830 |
| ...                      |
| sp_start:   0x2...b80000 |
+--------------------------+
```

`BSP` means Backing Store Pointer. That memory area is used by CPU to
back up and restore CPU register values (but not other local variables)
for each procedure call/return for caller-save registers. Usually C
programs don't need to care about `bsp` value or area contents.
It means that we should try hard not to lose `bsp` area when we are
tearing down the stack because register spilling/loading happens at
unusual times: CPU can defer or avoid spilling/reloading registers to
speed up performance.
Thus the fix could look like that ([proposed
upstream](https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2017-06/msg01265.html)):

```

Here we skip `PTHREAD_STACK_MIN` bytes from both beginning and end of
`pd->stackblock`. This fixed `pthread_create` `SIGSEGV`. Why it did
not exhibit before? I have no idea! My guess would be that older `glibc`
used less stack space and didn't bother to reload from `bsp` after
`madvise` call.

## Random facts about `ia64`

- default page size on `linux` is `64K`
- rare (unique?) setup of two stacks growing in opposite directions
- many garbage collector implementations have to special-case for
  `bsp` area as additional pointers can lurk there
- thread shutdown is delicate in `glibc`

Have fun!
