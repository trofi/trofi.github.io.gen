Tl;DR: `xmms2-0.9.4` is out and you can get it at
<https://github.com/xmms2/xmms2-devel/releases/tag/0.9.4>!

[`xmms2`](https://github.com/xmms2) is still a music player
daemon with various plugins to support stream decoding and
transformation. See
[older announcement](/posts/244-xmms2-0.9.1-is-out.html) on how to
get started with `xmms2`.

## Highlights

It's a small maintenance release. The only notable change is support for
`ffmpeg-7` as a build dependency.

Have fun!
