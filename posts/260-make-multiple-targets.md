title: "GNU make amends rules with multiple targets"
date: September 25, 2022
---

## TL;DR

Starting from `GNU make-4.4` rules with multiple targets that include
commands will trigger if any of the targets does not exist. This will
require a few projects to adapt. Older versions of `ghc` are affected.

Typical example would need to adapt from something like:

```makefile
%.gen.c %.gen.h %.gen.not-always-present: %.src
	$(CMD) ...
```

to something like:

```makefile
%.gen.c %.gen.h: %.src
	$(CMD) ...

%.gen.not-always-present: %.gen.c
	: # generated by previous rule or not generated at all
```

See <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?63098> for other options.

## More words

`Makefile` usually defines a bunch of prerequisites per single target:

```makefile
foo: foo.c foo.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDLIBS) foo.c -o foo
```

For dependency-only rules without commands it's customary to specify
multiple targets:

```makefile
all: foo bar

# multiple targets
foo bar: foo.h

# equivalent to
#   foo: foo.h
#   bar: foo.h

foo:
	touch foo

bar:
	touch bar

foo.h:
	touch foo.h
```

In all the cases above the behaviour is straightforward: if `foo.h`
changes then `foo` and `bar` are outdated and have to be rebuilt (if
rebuild is requested). And specifically `make foo` should cause only
`foo` rebuild. Example session:

```
$ make
touch foo.h
touch foo
touch bar

$ touch foo.h
$ make foo
touch foo
```

No surprise here: in a second run `bar` is not rebuilt and stays
outdated (we did not ask for it's update). And `foo` is rebuilt
as expected.

In `GNU make` before `4.3.90` the same rule applied to rules with
commands as well:

```makefile
all: foo bar

foo bar: foo.h
	touch foo bar

foo.h:
	touch foo.h
```

Note that the command for `foo bar: foo.h` rule always builds both
targets.

Let's try to delete `bar` and ask `foo` to be rebuilt. Would `foo` get
rebuilt? Would `bar` get rebuilt? Here is the answer:

```
$ make-4.3
touch foo.h
touch foo bar

$ rm bar
$ make-4.3 foo
make: 'foo' is up to date.
```

Looks exactly the same as above: `foo` does not require a refresh.

Now let's try `make-4.3.90`:

```
$ rm -f foo bar foo.h

$ make-4.3.90
touch foo bar

$ rm bar
$ make-4.3.90 foo
touch foo bar
```

That's a different behaviour: absence of `bar` triggers both `foo`
and `bar` rebuilds. This behaviour change is intentional and is added in
<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?62809>.

## The impact

So far it looks benign: we'll build just a bit more than we used to
in some incremental builds. Fresh-from-zero builds should not be
affected, right? Right?

I installed fresh `make-4.3.90` and attempted to build the world.

### opensp case

`opensp-1.5.2` being an autotools package provides tarballs with pre-generated
files as part of the release:

```makefile
%.h %.cxx %.rc: %.msg
	[ ! -f $(top_srcdir)/msggen.pl ] || $(PERL) -w $(top_srcdir)/msggen.pl $(MSGGENFLAGS) $<
```

All `.h`, `.cxx` and `.rc` files are already present in
`OpenSP-1.5.2.tar.gz`. User never has to run `msggen.pl` script to get
`opensp` built.

Except that `msggen.pl` does not always produce `.cxx` files. It does so
only for `.msg` files that have a `!cxx` directive. I noticed it only
because `msggen.pl` does not really work on any modern `perl` version
(and also because `nix` does not expose `perl` to build sandbox by default).
Fun fact: `OpenSP-1.5.2.tar.gz` was released in 2007.

The build fails on `make-4.3.90` as:

```
$ make-4.3.90
make[2]: Entering directory '/build/OpenSP-1.5.2/lib'
[ ! -f ../msggen.pl ] || perl -w ../msggen.pl -l libModule PosixStorageMessages.msg
bash: line 1: perl: command not found
make[2]: *** [Makefile:778: PosixStorageMessages.h] Error 127 shuffle=1663959693
```

The [proposed fix](https://sourceforge.net/p/openjade/bugs/151/) makes
`.cxx` as optional by splitting out `.cxx` into a separate rule:

```diff
--- a/lib/Makefile.am
+++ b/lib/Makefile.am
@@ -125,5 +125,7 @@ SUFFIXES = .msg .m4 .rc
 .m4.cxx:
 	$(PERL) $(top_srcdir)/instmac.pl $< >$@

+%.h %.rc: %.msg
	[ ! -f $(top_srcdir)/msggen.pl ] || $(PERL) -w $(top_srcdir)/msggen.pl $(MSGGENFLAGS) $<
+%.cxx: %.rc
+	: # built by perl rule above
```

Here we move `.cxx` part as a separate no-op target to avoid `perl`
build rule from triggering. Similar fix had to be applied to a few
more `Makefile.am` files in `opensp` tree.

The failure Does not look bad: it was easy to diagnose and workaround.

### ghc case

`ghc` was another heavy `GNU make` user until
[recenty](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/commit/6fd9b0a1c6b076ef1977db1a2ce8b9505b9a3254).
Many distributions still package older `ghc` versions and still use
`GNU make` based build system. `ghc` was broken by `make-4.3.90` as:

```

ghc> make: *** [Makefile:126: all] Error 2 shuffle=1664105902
```

Looks simple, right? No, it does not. `ghc`'s build system detected
infinite rebuild loop and bailed out. Note how `Reflect.hs` gets
generated at elast twice with `HSC2HS` haskell code generator.

To explain it's mechanics I'll build a contrived example:

```Makefile
foo:
	touch foo

%.d: %.c
	echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
	echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d

%.c:
	touch $*.c

-include foo.d

.PRECIOUS: foo.c
```

Here we dynamically generate a part of a `Makefile` by generating
`foo.d` file and by including it via `-include foo.d`. Leading
minus(`-`) ignores some error conditions when including files.

Let's try it:

```
$ rm -f foo* && make-4.3.90
touch foo.c
echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d
touch foo
```

Note that initially `foo` does not contain any dependencies.
`GNU make` has to build `foo.d` part first to see the rest of the
dependencies.

Interestingly `GNU make` has to re-executes itself after `foo.d` is
availble. We can see it in debug (`-d`) mode by looking up
`Re-executing` lines:

```
$ rm -f foo* && LANG=C make-4.3.90 -d |& grep Re-
Re-executing[1]: make -d
```

Now let's extend our `foo.c` rule (`foo.d`'s dependency) to include an
unrelated and non-existent `foo.h` file as an output target:

```diff
--- a/makefile
+++ b/makefile
@@ -5,8 +5,9 @@ foo:
 	echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
 	echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d

-%.c:
+%.c %.h:
 	touch $*.c
+	# missing 'touch $*.h'

 -include foo.d

```

Running:

```
$ rm -f foo* && make-4.3.90
touch foo.c
# missing 'touch foo.h'
echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d

touch foo.c
# missing 'touch foo.h'
echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d

touch foo.c
# missing 'touch foo.h'
echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d

touch foo.c
# missing 'touch foo.h'
echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d

touch foo.c
# missing 'touch foo.h'
echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d
...
```

`GNU make` fell into an infinite loop. Here missing `foo.h` file triggers
`make` to always regenerate `foo.d` on each re-execution. Regenrated
`foo.d` requires another re-execution. We get the loop. Previous
`make-4.3` version did not exhibit this behaviour:

```
$ rm -f foo* && make-4.3
touch foo.c
# missing 'touch foo.h'
echo "foo.d: foo.c"  > foo.d
echo "foo: foo.d foo.c" >> foo.d
touch foo
```

Now back to `ghc`. It took me some time to read through `make -d` output
to find the offending rule. The following fix was enough to fix `ghc`:

```diff

```

`hsc2hs` does not always emit `C` stub part. The fix is almost identical
to `opensp` case: we split out optional output into a separate rule.

As `ghc` dropped `GNU make`-based build system I did not try to upstream
the change. Downstreams would have to carry something similar for older
`ghc` versions they ship.

### dtc case

`dtc` also happens to use `GNU make`-based build system. It's `Makefile`
is a lot smaller than `ghc`'s one. The symptom was very similar to our
contrived example:

```
$ make-4.3.90
...
        CHK version_gen.h
         BISON dtc-parser.tab.h
         DEP dtc-lexer.lex.c
         DEP dtc-parser.tab.c
        CHK version_gen.h
         BISON dtc-parser.tab.h
         DEP dtc-lexer.lex.c
         DEP dtc-parser.tab.c
        CHK version_gen.h
         BISON dtc-parser.tab.h
         DEP dtc-lexer.lex.c
         DEP dtc-parser.tab.c
        CHK version_gen.h
         BISON dtc-parser.tab.h
         DEP dtc-lexer.lex.c
         DEP dtc-parser.tab.c
...
```

It took me a few hours to notice that `dtc` build was stuck.

The cause of cycle was again `make` re-execution caused by a missing
file in `bison` rule with multiple targets. `bison` rule contained
output that is never used by anything. The fix is trivial:

```diff
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile
@@ -384,4 +384,4 @@ clean: libfdt_clean pylibfdt_clean tests_clean
-%.tab.c %.tab.h %.output: %.y
+%.tab.c %.tab.h: %.y

 	$(BISON) -b $(basename $(basename $@)) -d $<
```

While at it I added a guard against infinite re-execution similar to
`ghc`'s guard:

```diff

+ifeq ($(MAKE_RESTARTS),10)
+$(error "Make re-executed itself $(MAKE_RESTARTS) times. Infinite recursion?")
+endif
```

`GNU make` provides `$(MAKE_RESTARTS)` variable to detect `make` restarts.

Both fixes are proposed upatream as <https://github.com/dgibson/dtc/pull/73>.

## Parting words

Rules with multiple targets are tricky and fun. `GNU make-4.4` will be a
bit more eager at rebuilding all of the targets if prerequisite changes.
This will expose bugs in a few programs. They shoud be easy to adapt.
Otherwise keeping an older version of `GNU make` in parallel to the
newer one should be a reasonable workaround as well.

So far only `opensp`, `ghc` and `dtc` needed fixing.

Have fun!
