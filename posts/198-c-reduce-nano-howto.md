title: c-reduce nano howto
date: March 5, 2017

What is `c-reduce`? The [home page](http://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/)
gives very nice explanation:

``` 
C-Reduce is a tool that takes a large C, C++, or OpenCL file that has a property of interest
(such as triggering a compiler bug) and automatically produces a much smaller C/C++ file that
has the same property. It is intended for use by people who discover and report bugs in compilers
and other tools that process source code.
```

Yesterday `Amynka` shared an interesting guile build failure: [bug
#610052](https://bugs.gentoo.org/610052)
The build error is of rare and cryptic sort:

```

`internal compiler error: SSA corruption` says the thing we see is a
`GCC` bug. User provided plenty information like:

- `gcc` version: `4.9.4`
- CPU: `AMD A10 7850K Radeon R7`
- `CFLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native -Os -pipe -ggdb"`

I've tried to reproduce it on `i7-2700K` CPU and did not succeed.
`-march=native` is a flag that picks instructions available on
currently running CPU model+`GCC` version.
To find out what `AMD A10 7850K` translates to I've looked at
available `-march=` options in `man gcc`.
That is a huge list even for `x86_64`. I had to pick from an extensive
`AMD` subset (starts at `-march=k6`). Something like
`-march=amdfam10` or later (`-march=bdver1`, `-march=bdver2`,
etc.) looked like a good match. I chose `-march=bdver2` mostly at
random :)

``` 
bdver2
    AMD Family 15h core based CPUs with x86-64 instruction set support.
    (This supersets BMI, TBM, F16C, FMA, FMA4, AVX, XOP, LWP, AES,
    PCL_MUL, CX16, MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4A, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2,
    ABM and 64-bit instruction set extensions.)
```

Reran build command changing `-march=native` to `-march=bdver2`

``` 
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DBUILDING_LIBGUILE=1 -I.. -I.. -I../lib -I../lib -I/usr/lib64/libffi-3.2.1/include -I/var/tmp/portage/dev-scheme/guile-2.0.14/work/guile-2.0.14 -pthread -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wpointer-arith -Wswitch-enum -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv -fvisibility=hidden -march=bdver2 -mtune=bdver2 -Os -pipe -ggdb -c vm.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/libguile_2.0_la-vm.o
```

and got the same `GCC` crash. Yay! Now we have something to look
at.

`vm.c` relies on local (to `guile`) and system headers. It's not
clear what triggered the error, so I wanted to get a self-contained
example. `GCC` bug reporting manual
[suggests](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/) using `-save-temps` option to
bundle everything required into a single file. Single files are easier
to deal with.

``` 
gcc ...<skip>... -march=bdver2 -mtune=bdver2 -Os -pipe -ggdb -c vm.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/libguile_2.0_la-vm.o -save-temps
```

The result is stored in `vm.i`. We can shrink our compile command down
to:

``` 
gcc -march=bdver2 -mtune=bdver2 -Os -c vm.i
```

`vm.i` file is `1052623` bytes long (a book of decent size). Who
knows what went wrong there.
Googling for `internal compiler error: SSA corruption` revealed quite
a few bugs related to `SSA` bugs. One of bugs hinted at `c-reduce`
as a tool to shrink original `C` source files.
I've decided to give it a try. `c-reduce` is very easy to use: we
need to construct a wrapper script that has 2 exit codes:

- `0` - interesting case (or "bug is triggered" in our case)
- `1` - uninteresting case (or "bug is gone")

``` bash
# cat test.sh
LANG=C gcc-4.9.4 -march=bdver2 -O1 -c vm.i -o vm.o >gcc_out.txt 2>&1
grep 'internal compiler error' gcc_out.txt >/dev/null 2>&1
```

That's it! Let's start the process:

```
$ time creduce ./test.sh vm.i
===< 2043 >===
running 4 interestingness tests in parallel
===< pass_includes :: 0 >===
===< pass_unifdef :: 0 >===
===< pass_comments :: 0 >===
(0.0 %, 1052583 bytes)
===< pass_blank :: 0 >===
(0.8 %, 1044718 bytes)
(5.1 %, 998478 bytes)
===< pass_clang_binsrch :: replace-function-def-with-decl >===
(6.4 %, 985456 bytes)
(8.3 %, 965433 bytes)
(8.7 %, 960939 bytes)
...
...<takes a while>...
...
      ******** /tmp/y/vm.i ********

*a;
b() {
  char *c;
  static d;
  e();
  d = c++;
  f();
  _setjmp();
  goto *a[*c];
}

real    7m53,030s
user    19m0,687s
sys     3m37,214s
```

The final result is stored in original `vm.i` file:

``` c
*a;
b() {
  char *c;
  static d;
  e();
  d = c++;
  f();
  _setjmp();
  goto *a[*c];
}
```

Only 88 bytes! Not the best piece of `C` ever written but still
perfectly valid. And way better than original size-wise :)
This code is portable as it does not contain any `gcc` version-specific
intrinsics like `__builtin_va_list` or anything like that.
Now we more or less know what to look for. `GCC` had a [similar
bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/PR57584) where `-O1 -ftree-vectorize` was
enough to trigger internal compiler error (aka `ICE`).
Our case is even simpler. It's not CPU model specific anymore:

``` 
$ gcc-4.9.4 -c vm.i -O1
...
Unable to coalesce ssa_names 2 and 9 which are marked as MUST COALESCE.
c_2(ab) and  c_9(ab)
```

So, why wasn't the original bug triggered on my `-march=corei7-avx`
machine? I don't know! Perhaps `GCC` intermediate representation
slightly depends on target CPU model.

None of `gcc-5.4.0` or `gcc-6.3.0` crash on that small snippet of
code. The bug was likely fixed but not merged to `gcc-4.9` branch.
`gcc-4.9.4` was [the final
release](https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2016-07/msg00084.html) in `4.9`
branch.

Random findings:

- `-save-temps` and `c-reduce` automates away large part of test
  simplification! We need to build similar tools for `haskell`. It's
  quite tedious to do shrinking by hands.
- old compilers have scary bugs :)
- It is tricky to figure out what `-march=native` expands to. `gc -v`
  can help you in that :)

Have fun!
